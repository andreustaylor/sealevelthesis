# Coastal sea level predictability in the context of mesoscale operational oceanography

## concept

How can public tide predictions be improved in the context of operational global ocean circulation forecasts?
 - Coastal sea level forecasts over synoptic timescales are important.
 - Conventional tide tables are culturally embedded and offer unique types of predictive skill.
 - Maturation of global OGCM operational forecasts invites re-assessment of methods.


## progress review comments

Ongoing employment at Bureau of Meteorology remains aligned and reinforces relevance of research outcomes.
All compute and resource use via BoM. 
Some challenge to balance operational sea level forecasting demands with research output.   
Opportunities exist to make further use of formal leave arrangements to accelerate progress. 

Primary concerns are time limits from the Schools perspective and ensuring I maintain wider academic engagement.

## elements

  1. literature review 
  2. (100) aggregation of forecasts
  3. (080) coastal wave guide perspective 
  4. (040) conventional tide tables and spectral overlap
