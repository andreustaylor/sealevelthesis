\begin{itemize}
    \item incompatible definitions of ocean ``tide'';
    \item mesoscale ocean adds (qualified) coastal value;
    \item tidal signals are in non-tidal simulations;
    \item point-based aggregation provides an important skill benchmark;
    \item point-based bias patterns promising for full coastal extrapolation;
    \item coastal propagation is relevant for candidate forecast systems;
    \item waveguide projection good for forecasters too;  
    \item conventional tides are not redundant
    \item ...but are ripe for rethink on products.
\end{itemize}
