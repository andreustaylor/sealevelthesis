This body of work was motivated by specific conceptual problems identified beneath the forecasting of sea level at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.  The intersection of conventional tide prediction and operational mesoscale ocean forecasts within the agency is problematic with regard to issues of representation, system compatibility and user expectation.
This desktop study has intentionally not pursued higher resolution simulations, but instead directed attention to some less-studied aspects of evaluating and exploiting established operational systems.   Such as perspective is relevant to the planned development of multi-model seamless services.   
%\emph{%
%Is the operationalisation of high resolution coastal simulations a prerequisite for providing regular sea level forecasts?  Despite comparatively low coastal resolution, can \BL{} directly provide useful prognosis of non-tidal coastal sea level and with what limitations? }
%\emph{Are point-by-point tide-gauge observations the only relevant basis on which to compare and assess heterogeneous sea level forecast simulations? 
%Why is the role of coastally trapped waves prominent in the oceanographic literature but seemingly absent from operational forecasting?}
%\emph{Has numerical simulation rendered conventional tide prediction redundant for operations?  How can the unique traditional function of tide prediction compliment nominally non-tidal ocean forecasts and future seamless prediction systems? }
Much of the body of this thesis has been published in a series of peer-reviewed articles.

\section{Heterogeneous simulations, compatibility and seamless services}

Numerical forecasts from agencies like the Australian Bureau of Meteorology have arguably been under-utilised as a result of system heterogeneity.   It is not self-evident how to take into account the prognostic information ostensibly available in non-tidal sea level anomaly, storm surge and tide-table products; whereas all could be simultaneously issued to the public. 
Likewise, blending the information from climate, short term and long term forecasts for decision making is in general fraught with details of compatibility and continuity.

Seamless apparently coined or at least promoted early on by \citet{10.1175/bams-89-4-459}.
Whereas the original focus was on multi-scale physical compatibility, the notion has been extended to service ...towards seamless services \cite{BOM2020}

general pursuit of "seamless" is current \cite{10.1127/metz/2020/1048}



This thessiu 

The cascade of simulatied scales and incremental move to higher fidelity `contrete' simulations  ...
perhaps related spectral wave forecasts to phase resolving ....


Operational reality is expected to always consist to a some degree of a suite of systems that are not cleanly compatiable ....

\section{Next steps}

Primacy of observational data and metadata

Expansion to more heterogenous and diverse quality data ...video etc


Seamless ...

Microservice architecture 
...foundational prediction systems 
...accessible and machine-readable 
...contrast to highly targeted vertical stack like ROAM   ...better to ensure value can be extracted and 

Historical legacy and user adapatation ...

All in the context of repairing whilst on 

Something about keeping up connection and dialogue with academic and cutting edge ....bluelink collaboration ...not just user pull ...
