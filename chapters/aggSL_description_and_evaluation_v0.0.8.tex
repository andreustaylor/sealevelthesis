% Abstract (Do not use inserted blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{ A system for providing routine 7-day forecasts of sea level observable at tide gauge locations is described and evaluated.
Forecast timeseries are aggregated from well established operational systems of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology operations; though these systems are only quasi-complimentray.
The forecasts can add value to routine coastal decision processes under non-extreme conditions; such as seagate and fish weir operations, under keel clearance systems and flood warning models. Practical levels of skill are demonstrated for such applications at a range of locations in the Australian region.
The configuration is relatively robust to operational realities such as version upgrades, data gaps and metadata ambiguities.
Forecast skill is evaluated against hourly sea level observations at tide gauge locations.  Notable exceptions to application include extreme forcing scenarios such as tropical cyclones, tsunami.
Characteristics of the bias correction term are demonstrated to be primarily static in time, but with time varying signals showing some spatial coherence.
Concluded that the current simple configuration provides limited but potentially useful levels of skill.; and that interpolation between observations sites could be meaningfully pursued. Furthermore, this general aggregation approach may prove to be optimal for routine sea level forecast services given the phyically inhomogeneous processes involved.}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Context}

% still sea level is relevant
Of the activities that now constitute 'operational oceanography' \cite{Bell:2009uv}, sea level forecasting possibly has the most historical baggage as well as the most widespread application.
Day-to-day routine decisions are based on expectations of still water level \cite{Pugh:2014vf} at the coast.  
For example in sea-gate and fish weir operations [REF], under keel clearance systems [REF], coastal works scheduling and indirectly for activities at river mouthes (ee QLD dam outflow) [REF] 
Extreme variations in sea level, such as due to tropical cyclones and tsunami, are not the focus of the present document.

Diverse processes -> evolution of specialised modelling approaches for different time scales and processes\\
Many routine decisions dont care about distinctions ...just need to know the sea level.\\
Nested downscaling offers many attractions but may not prove to be the optimal approach for services.  Futhermore, nesting approaches have been motivated by technological limitations rather than phyicss .... contract adapative meshes, tidal ephemeris etc\\

Australia is a large domain tha highlights varianble balance of processes.\\


\subsection{tide predictions as special class of data driven}

Conventional tide predictions are a remarkaby successful forecast product that provide an omni-present reference for coastal activities.
By design these unique predictions make no account for the aperiodic phemomena that constitute 'non tidal' energy. 
Production involves timeseries statistics based on historical records of observations at each forecast site.
Tidal techniques exploit the significance of periodic sea level variations observed to be coherent with the astronomical tide producing forces (ATGF) \cite{Hendershott:1981ub}.     
By assuming that historical coherence is time invarient, astronomical motions can be mapped to predicted sea level via an admittance function.   
Useful sea level predictions can thereby be produced many years into the future.  
Many variations exist for implementing this general approach (eg \cite{Foreman:2009bg}, \cite{Groves:1975ky},\cite{LEFFLER:2009ej},\cite{Smith:1997ut} ). 
But tidal methods based on a harmonic decompostion of the ATGF have long been typical of bodies promolgating 'official' tidal products; including the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
Statistical properties of offical tidal predictions have come to define elevation references for mapping and legal applications \cite{PCTMSL:2009vy}.
%In Australia tidal activities are distributed between the Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian Hydrographic Service (now a section of Geospatial Intellegence Unit of Defence).


% periodic but not astro 
The ongoing value of standard tidal predictions reflects the fact that periodic signals generally dominate coastal still water levels.
It is notable however that the physical drivers of sea level represented in tidal predictions need not be graviational at all; for instance at longer periods \cite{Parker:2007wq}
The extent to which conventional harmonic tidal predictions are 'physics free' actually allows for a pragmatic flexibilty to represent almost all of the everyday rise and fall of coastal sea level at a place.
Purely physical models of ocean tides are really only of academic interest (eg \cite{Weis:2008ex} \cite{Muller:2008hs}).
Important spatial tidal solutions ultimately draw a trade-off between physics and observations \cite{Egbert:1996vr}; that is, gridded tidal products are inferior to a standard tide.

\subsection{dynamic models and DA}

% downscaling and models
In contrast to the 
Application of primative equation dynamic models to the task of forecasting routine coastal sea level is increasingly relevant,  to reto provide operational 
There has been much scientifc  canonical approach to coastal forecasting in the operational oceanographic context is via dynamical downscaling eg \cite{Paramygin:2017dx} \cite{Garzon:2016ds}.
Regional dynamic downscaling of OceanMAPS forecasts is undertaken by the Bureau for special applications (cites?),
but spatial and temporal coverage is not yet comprehensive.\\
Dedicated storm surge forecasting systems have been developed and are currently in transition to operational support (cite Greenslade CandP).   These new systems are based on higher resolution barotropic-only models, without no outer nesting global model, over shorter forecast windows. These new surge forecast systems are not addressed further in this document. \\


More

The capability of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) to operationally observe and forecast the ocean has expanded in the last decade;
and recent efforts are increasingly directing towards coastal regions.  
It is notable that operationally supported systems are designed and configured in a manner distinct from academic modelling studies. 
Several existing operationally supported systems involve aspects of coastal sea level;
but these are only quasi-complimentary with regard to providing practical sea level forecasts over synoptic timescales. \\


What is available now?\\
Exlusion of wave setup - parsimony and typically out of surf zone.\\
Riverine inputs ...not included though aggSL is feed into dependant ratings \\


A diverse range of 'users' make decisions that involve expectations about sea level. 
But the academic decomposition of signals attributed to observed sea level is often irrelevant or a source of miscommunication. 

Forecasts need to be fit-for-purpose and reliably available: all models are wrong, but some are useful \cite{Box:1979hl} .

The Australian coastline spans a vast geographic extent that features long regions of interconnected oceanography \cite{Ridgway:2004kb}, \cite{Church:1986tl}, \cite{Haigh:2013bn}, \cite{Woodham:2013cl}.  Across this domain the balance of physical contributions to coastal sea level variation is diverse.\\


Bureau operations include conventional harmonic analysis and tide tables.
These continue to provide a foundational and unique forecast product with myriad applications.
Although harmonic analysis is based on historical records, real-time communication of tide gauge observations has become the norm.
The Bureau operates its own network of tide gauges \cite{Greenslade:2012um} but also ingests observations from many operated by partner organisations.   
Gathering observations from diverse organisations is valuable but can raise issues with data qualuity and metadata managment.



'Operational oceanography' \cite{Bell:2009uv} has matured in a manner analogous to numerical weather prediction (NWP).
Near-global ocean forecasts have been in operational production now for 10 years via several versions of OceanMAPS  
\cite{Brassington:2007ut}\cite{NMOC:2007wq}\cite{BureauofMeterology:2011ta}\cite{Brassington:2012wm}.
The current version of this data-assimilating primitive equation forecast system is configured to represent mesoscale ocean variability with regular structured horizontal discretisation of 0.1x0.1 degrees.
Forecasts for the next 7-days are produced daily using a multi-cycle ensemble schedule \cite{GaryBBrassington:2013jw}.

\section{Forecast System Concept}

The concept is a simple but careful linear superposition to provide an enhance tide prediction.
Heterogeneous operational sea level systems are aggregated into a single package to better exploit existing information.
Particularly so as to facilitate direct comparison to recent observations.

Systems to include/exclude:\\


\subsection{Motivation}
This approach is motivated by the immediate potential of exploiting existing systems to present useful sea level guidance;  7-day forecasts that can be directly evaluated against tide gauge observations.
A secondary motivation is to establish a performance benchmark against which new sea level forecast capabilities can be evaluated. \\

%\subsection{Hypothesis}
%\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=5.8mm]
%\item Value is timesscale dependant: relatable to length scales in ocean model
%\item forecast skill decays with lead time
%\item Dynamic models add forecast value beyond persistence only beyond ?
%\item Ocean model adds information beyond that available in local wind forecast.
%\item Bias correction accounts for (1) fixed offsets (2) inadequately resolved physical %phenomena of large spatial scale.
%\end{itemize}
 


% hthe represent relative timing of contributing phenomena;
The concept is schematically illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:aggSL} and elements are detailed in subsequent sections.

%The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text. For example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text, but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data is shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary data. Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.

%\section{}
%All appendix sections must be cited in the main text. In the appendixes, Figures, Tables, etc. should be labeled starting with `A', e.g., Figure A1, Figure A2, etc.
