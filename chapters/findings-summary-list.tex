\begin{itemize}
    \item Incompatible definitions of ocean ``tide'' are in parallel operational use;
    \item despite spatial scale limitations, mesoscale ocean forecasts can directly provide significant forecast value for coastal sea level, but with many caveats;
    \item nominally tidal signals are present in mesoscale non-tidal ocean simulations and require care to avoid misinterpretation; 
    \item a simple aggregation approach to existing heterogeneous data provides an important skill benchmark for future sea level forecast system development; 
    \item point-based bias correction characteristics indicates that coastally contiguous extensions to model aggregation are feasible;
    \item the coastal propagation characteristics of candidate forecast systems can be qualitatively evaluated and compared in a grid-independent waveguide projection; 
    \item a coastal waveguide projection offers a means to direct forecaster attention to signals of special relevance along the Australian mainland coast;
    \item conventional harmonic tide predictions are not redundant but require appropriate product differentiation to compliment modern applications and facilitate future refinement.
