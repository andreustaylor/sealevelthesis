\chapter{Sea level forecasting concepts}
\begin{quote}
{\small
This chapter provides an exposition of the place of tide prediction and mesoscale ocean forecasting within the operational setting.
Focus is directed to clarifying key concepts and the treatment of physical processes that are unresolved by each forecasting approach.   
Overall the discussion is couched within a historical framework that emphasises the place of the current operational capabilities within the ongoing evolution of ocean observation and forecasting more generally.
This discussion forms the basis on which subsequent chapters are built.
