Instruments, stilling well as filter, lidar                       | fair points | additional refernces and comments | around pp5
History and "never pins down a definition"                        | fair points, Reidy history suggestion was a very good idea | re-worded with expanded history comments | around pp14
Several comments on nonstationarity                               | all fair   | re-worded some parts with addtional references  | chpt 2 and 5 
Legal uses - cadastre                                            | agree, looked into US references but reluctant to divert too far from core Australian focus | re-worded and added references to extra Australian uses | Sec 5.5
More on international relevance                                 | international cross-comparison would be great but again reluctant to divert too far from core Australian focus | Re-worded some phrases and included additional references to USA comparitive institutions in partiular | Chp1 and 5 


## Andy's working playback and summary

### Examiner 1
Primarily spelling and format changes required.

### Examiner 2
More substantive changes required.

Some clarification about the orthogonality of sinusoidal basis functions is needed, and the concept of the Rayleigh criterion should be introduced—see notes below. 

overtides in prediction non-stationarity (and prediction error) is not considered in Chapter 5, time variation in the major constituents is identified as a potential issue, but not quantitatively explored.  At the least, such issues could be brought up in the future steps in the conclusion. 

Especially in chapter 5 and chapter 6, there may also be opportunities to more clearly delineate how findings are important in an international context (some of the results in chapter 5 are rather country specific, though one could probably show relevance in other contexts).  

of good information (especially for non-specialists that may read it in the future).
