# Examiner response plan and comments Nov 2021

## Approach
1. ~~revise and revive production tools: overleaf, github, Papers ~~
2. ~~digest feedback~~
3. ~~initial summary of revision requirements in unimelb standard table format (below)~~
* ~~update panel~~ *
4. obtain references mentioned by reviewers
5. fix listed spelling/typos
6. fix cite format problem
7. digest new references
8. add new references to bib
7. re-write and extend sections where required
8. spellcheck very well
9. update the change table
10.  update panel
11.  re-submit

## Andy's working playback and summary

### Examiner 1
Primarily spelling and format changes required.

### Examiner 2
More substantive changes required.

Some clarification about the orthogonality of sinusoidal basis functions is needed, and the concept of the Rayleigh criterion should be introduced—see notes below. 

overtides in prediction non-stationarity (and prediction error) is not considered in Chapter 5, time variation in the major constituents is identified as a potential issue, but not quantitatively explored.  At the least, such issues could be brought up in the future steps in the conclusion. 

Especially in chapter 5 and chapter 6, there may also be opportunities to more clearly delineate how findings are important in an international context (some of the results in chapter 5 are rather country specific, though one could probably show relevance in other contexts).  

of good information (especially for non-specialists that may read it in the future).
