abstract = {{It is commonly held that interannual-to-decadal sea level variability patterns mainly represent the ocean's response to wind forcing. This view is based in part on modeling studies of wind-driven sea level changes along the tropical Pacific. However, because buoyancy forcing (and other generating mechanisms) are usually ignored, this paradigm may overemphasize the role of winds. Focusing on the southeast tropical Pacific, we use a data-constrained ocean state estimate to demonstrate that distinct mechanisms\&\#8212;including the ocean's response to buoyancy forcing as well as nonlinear processes\&\#8212;can also contribute to interannual sea level variability. Contrary to the notion that buoyancy-driven sea level changes are dynamically passive, such changes exhibit a strongly nonlocal, dynamically active character, made manifest in westward propagating waves. As similar findings apply elsewhere, accurate modeling of interannual-to-decadal regional sea level changes requires consideration of a variety of forcing mechanisms, including, but not limited to, the winds.}},

Comparison is made between a 300-year run of the original model and the free-surface version, using a very coarse North Atlantic calculation as the basis. The results are very similar, differing only in the streamfunction over topography; this is to be expected, since the treatment of topographic torques on the barotropic flow differs because of the nature of the modifications.}},

These models, in conjunction with the IOM, have been used to investigate a wide variety of scientific phenomena including tidal, mesoscale, and wind-driven circulation.

In contrast to forcing with prescribed fluxes, the bulk forcing utilizes the evolving model sea surface temperatures and monthly atmospheric fields based on reanalyses by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and on satellite data products. The vertical mixing in the oceanic boundary layer is governed by a nonlocal K-profile parameterization (KPP) and is matched to parameterizations of mixing in the interior. The KPP scheme is designed to represent well both convective and wind-driven entrainment. The near- equilibrium solutions are compared to a baseline experiment in which the surface tracers are strongly restored everywhere to climatology and the vertical mixing is conventional with constant coefficients, except where there is either conve...}},

The long-wavelength component of the geocentric pole tide deformations at the Chandler wobble period is observed from T/P altimetry to be consistent with the theoretical self-consistent equilibrium response of the ocean pole tide. The geocentric pole tide explains 70\% of the variance in the degree 2 order 1 spherical harmonic component of the residual sea surface heights that are observed by T/P, after removing the seasonal, inverse barometer, and lunisolar tidal effects. If the long-wavelength component of the ocean pole tide is assumed to have an equilibrium response at the Chandler wobble period, then satellite altimetry proves to be another geodetic technique that can be used to estimate the Love number k2 at that period.}},

A reforecast ensemble dataset is used to explore this idea for the case in which the Markov chain has 12 states and 15 steps and the probability forecasts are for the event for which the 500-hPa geopotential height exceeds the climatological value at a specified point. Results suggest that the transition probabilities of the Markov chain are best modeled as first order if they are obtained from the reforecast ensemble dataset using maximum likelihood estimation. Most of the first-order-estimated transition probabilities are statistically significant. Also, the transition probabilities are inhomogeneous, and all states in the chain communicate. A variety of potential decision support applications for the Markov chain parameters are highlighted. In particular, the transition probabilities allow calculation of the conditional probability of taking ...}},

A parameterized topographic wave drag is inserted into the model and tuned so that the surface tidal elevations are of comparable accuracy to those in optimally tuned forward tide models used in previous studies. The model captures 93\% of the open-ocean sea-surface height variance of the eight largest tidal constituents, as recorded by a standard set of 102 pelagic tide gauges spread around the World Ocean. In order to minimize the impact of the wave drag on non-tidal motions, the model utilizes a running 25-h average to approximately separate tidal and non-tidal components of the near-bottom flow. In contrast to earlier high-resolution global baroclinic tide simulations, which utilized tidal forcing only, the simulation presented here has a horizontally non-uniform stratification, supported by the wind- and buoyancy forcing. The horizontally varying stratification affects the baroclinic tides in high latitudes to first order. The magnitude of the internal tide perturbations to sea surface elevation amplitude and phase in a large box surrounding Hawai’i is quite similar to that observed in satellite altimeter data, although the exact locations of peaks and troughs in the modeled perturbations differ from those in the observed perturbations.}},

Illustration of the method is provided using performance statistics from two previously published forecast verification studies (snowfall density and convective initiation) and a verification of several new forecast datasets: Storm Prediction Center forecasts of severe storms (nontornadic and tornadic), Hydrometeorological Prediction Center forecasts of heavy precipitation (greater than 12.5 mm in a 6-h period), National Weather Service Forecast Office terminal aviation forecasts (ceiling and visibility), and medium-range ensemble forecasts of 500-hPa height anomalies. The use of such verification metrics in concert with more detailed investigations to advance forecasting is briefly discussed.}},

abstract = {{This study investigates Australia's coastline complexity to establish the relationship between geological inheritance and ocean processes, as well as determine the characteristic length scales at which they operate. Each of Australia's geological regions displays discrete complexity signatures indicating a correlation between coastal complexity and geology. These mesoscale complexity signatures can vary enormously, between regions over a range of length scales. An angled measurement technique is used to quantify coastal complexity for a large number of random nodes, at varying length scales, around the Australian continental margin. Cluster analysis are used to determine characteristic complexity ‘signatures’ for random nodes, and dimension reduction techniques and additive models are used to assess the relative effects of wave and tide power and physical variables in each geological region. However, although some geological regions are visibly distinct, all geological regions are comprised of up to three basic classes or typologies. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that at the mesoscale (1–100km), geological inheritance has the major influence in determining coastal complexity. Results show lithological mix to be an important factor and coastlines of a homogeneous lithology tend to be straighter than coastlines of mixed lithology. They further demonstrate that wave action promotes a straight coastline if the lithology is homogeneous and a complex one if the lithology is heterogeneous This work will contribute to ongoing research in the classification of the Australian continental margin by utilising available geophysical datasets that are fundamental to the establishment of rigorous boundaries in the regional marine planning process. It provides important information about drivers responsible for coastal complexity at the mesoscale. It is only from such studies that constructive quantitative approaches can be developed for robust regionalisation of coastal and marine systems.}},

In this context, it is becoming increasingly important to monitor trends emerging from local (regional) records to augment global average measurements and future projections. The Australasian region has four very long, continuous tide gauge records, at Fremantle (1897), Auckland (1903), Fort Denison (1914), and Newcastle (1925), which are invaluable for considering whether there is evidence that the rise in mean sea level is accelerating over the longer term at these locations in line with various global average sea level time-series reconstructions.

The space and time sampling properties of the exact repeat, near-repeat, and crossover ground tracks have been analyzed to discover which tides may be estimated using a combination of conventional harmonic analysis and local spatial regression. Using this information, the M2, S2, K2, N2, K1, O1, P1, and Q1 tides have been mapped for both the ocean and floating ice shelves in this domain.

How can we determine whether specific regional climate projections may be untrustworthy in the light of such generic deficiencies? A calibration method is proposed whose basis lies in the emerging notion of seamless prediction. Specifically, calibrations of ensemble-based climate change probabilities are derived from analyses of the statistical reliability of ensemble-based forecast probabilities on seasonal time scales. The method is demonstrated by calibrating probabilistic projections from the multimodel ensembles used in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on reliability analyses from the seasonal forecast Development of a European Multimodel Ensemble System for Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction (DEMETER) dataset. The focus in this paper is on climate change projections of regional precipitation, though the method is more general.}},

The cyclonic winds are computed using a maximum pressure drop of the cyclone based on a 100-year return period. The coast is mapped for the maximum possible extent of inland inundation with water levels at the district level. The influence of climate change impact as a result of global warming on the coastal inundation is evaluated by enhancing the intensity of the cyclones. Peak water levels of about 10–12 m are found along the north of Odisha coast. The most vulnerable region in terms of coastal inundation in the present scenario is found in the districts of West Bengal; however, they are the least affected by about 5–6\% due to climate change scenario (CCS). The most affected inundated districts by more than 50\% due to CCS are observed in the Godavari deltaic region in Andhra Pradesh. Though the water levels in the Ramanathapuram District in Tamil Nadu reach more than 8 m in any scenario, the region is unaffected by the coastal inundation due to high local topography. By examining the inundated area of different water levels, it is revealed that more than 75\% of the total area is inundated with greater than 2 m water levels in the northern districts of Odisha and Ramanathapuram District in Tamil Nadu.}},

Bluelink information services are available to marine industries (e.g. commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, oil and gas, renewable energy), government agencies (e.g. search and rescue, defence, coastal management, environmental protection), and other stakeholders (e.g. recreation, water sports, artisanal and sport fishing) who depend on timely and accurate information about the marine environment. This review highlights the last 15 years of Bluelink achievements delivering mesoscale (eddy-resolving) to sub-mesoscale and short- to medium-range (days to weeks) ocean forecasts and reanalyses. Key achievements include the development of a global ocean forecasting and reanalysis system, a relocatable ocean-atmosphere model and a littoral zone analysis and forecasting capability. Beyond the traditional short-term forecasting of physical ocean properties (temperature, salinity, surface height, currents, waves), marine activities such as water quality and habitat management as well as climate monitoring increasingly rely on operational oceanographic data and products. These are areas of active research of the Bluelink team in collaboration with national and international partners.}},

In both simulations, the surface tidal error is minimized by tuning the strength of the linear wave drag, which is a parameterization of the surface-tide energy conversion to the unresolved baroclinic wave modes. In both simulations the M 2 surface tide error with TPXO8-atlas, an altimetry constrained model, is 2.6 cm. Compared to H12, the surface tide energy conversion to the resolved vertical modes is increased by 50\% in H25. This coincides with an equivalent reduction in the tuned loss of energy from the surface tide to the wave drag. For the configurations studied here, the horizontal and not the vertical resolution is the factor limiting the number of vertical modes that are resolved in most of the global ocean: modes 1–2 in H12 and modes 1–5 in H25. The wave drag also dampens the resolved internal tides. The 40\% reduction in wave-drag strength does not result in a proportional increase in the mode-1 energy density in H25. In the higher-resolution simulations, topographic mode-scattering and wave–wave interactions are better resolved. This allows for an energy flux out of mode 1 to the higher modes, mitigating the need for an internal tide damping term. The HYCOM simulations are validated with analytical conversion models and altimetry-inferred sea-surface height, fluxes, and surface tide dissipation. H25 agrees best with these data sets to within ∼ 10\%. To facilitate the comparison of stationary tide signals extracted from time series with different durations, we successfully apply a spatially-varying correction factor.}},

The vorticity field is a vector field, and vortex lines may be determined from a tangency condition similar to that relating streamlines to the fluid velocity field. However, vortex lines have several special properties and their presence or absence within a region of interest may allow certain simplifications of the field equations for fluid motion. In particular, vortex lines are carried by the flow and cannot end within the fluid, and this constrains their possible topology. Vorticity is typically present at solid boundaries and it may diffuse into the flow via the action of viscosity. Vorticity may be generated within a flow wherever pressure and density gradients are misaligned. The characteristics and geometry of a vortex line allow the velocity it induces at a distant location to be determined. Thus, multiple vortex lines that are free to move within a fluid may interact with each other. In a rotating coordinate frame, the observed vorticity depends or the frame's rotation rate.}},

abstract = {{In many areas, storm surges caused by tropical or extratropical cyclones are the main contributors to critical extreme sea level events. Storm surges can be simulated using numerical models that are based on the underlying physical processes, or by using data-driven models that quantify the relationship between the predictand (storm surge) and relevant predictors (wind speed, mean sea-level pressure, etc.). This study explores the potential of data-driven models to simulate storm surges globally. A multitude of predictors (obtained from remote sensing and climate reanalysis) along with predictands (from tide gage observations and storm surge reanalysis) are utilized to train and validate data-driven models to simulate daily maximum surge for the global coastline. Data-driven models simulate daily maximum surge better in extratropical and sub-tropical regions [average correlation and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.79 and 7.5 cm, respectively], than in the tropics (average correlation and RMSE of 0.45 and 5.3 cm, respectively). For extreme events, the average correlation decreases to 0.54 (0.33) and RMSE increases to 14.5 (13.1) cm for extratropical (tropical) regions. Models forced with remotely sensed predictors showed a slightly better performance (average correlation of 0.69) than models forced with predictors obtained from reanalysis products (average correlation of 0.68). Results also highlight a significant improvement (i.e., average correlation increases from 0.54 to 0.68; RMSE reduces from 11 to 7 cm) over the Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis (GTSR), derived from the only global hydrodynamic model. For approximately 70\% of tide gages, mean sea-level pressure is the most important predictor to model daily maximum surge. Our results highlight the added value of data-driven models in the context of simulating storm surges at the global scale, in addition to existing hydrodynamic numerical models.}},

To determine the coastline length of a country or a region, the scaling region and fractal dimension of the coastline is first calculated, and then, the length of the coastline is measured using the scale at the lower limit or near the limit of the scaling region. For this study, the scaling region of the continental coastline of China is determined. The box-counting dimension was calculated with ArcGIS software using 33 scales and a map scale of 1:500,000, and the divider dimension calculated by a C language program. Moreover, the reliability of the Chinese coastline length value, which is widely used currently, is discussed in this paper. The results show that the scaling region of the continental coastline of China is from 0.1 to 400 km. In the scaling region, the box-counting dimension and the divider dimension of the coastline are 1.2004 and 1.0929, respectively. According to fractal theory, the divider dimension more accurately represents the irregularity of a coastline. The length of the continental coastline of China is approximately 21,900 km when the measurement scale is 0.1 km; however, the length is 18,214 km when the scale is 0.25 km, and this value approaches the continental length of China (18,400 km) in popular use today. Although the coastline length is shorter than 21,900 km, the length is acceptable because the measurement scale (0.25 km) is close to the lower limit of the scaling region.}},

An example of such cyclonic events is Hurricane Gordon, which occurred during the second half of August 2012. Extreme hurricane-strength winds produced new and atypically low-frequency (about 14 s) packs of energy. The preexistent wave spectrum suddenly experienced an addition of low-frequency energy along the coast of Cádiz, Spain. This study presents the results of a comprehensive analysis developed to reconstruct the events produced by Hurricane Gordon (2012) along the coast of Cádiz. The analysis features the use of (i) parametric models for the characterization of hurricane winds and pressure fields, (ii) implementation of the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model for the generation and propagation of waves in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, and (iii) its coupling with the MOPLA?taken from the Spanish acronym for wave propagation model, current, and morphodynamic evolution of beaches?model for the evaluation of longshore currents. The numerical wave characterization, generation, and propagation were validated with instrumental data from deep-water and coastal buoys.}},

abstract = {{Discretization of the pressure-gradient force is a long-standing problem in terrain-following (or \&\#963;) coordinate oceanic modeling. When the isosurfaces of the vertical coordinate are not aligned with either geopotential surfaces or isopycnals, the horizontal pressure gradient consists of two large terms that tend to cancel; the associated pressure-gradient error stems from interference of the discretization errors of these terms. The situation is further complicated by the nonorthogonality of the coordinate system and by the common practice of using highly nonuniform stretching for the vertical grids, which, unless special precautions are taken, causes both a loss of discretization accuracy overall and an increase in interference of the component errors. In the present study, we design a pressure-gradient algorithm that achieves more accurate hydrostatic balance between the two components and does not lose as much accuracy with nonuniform vertical grids at relatively coarse resolution. This algorithm is based on the reconstruction of the density field and the physical z coordinate as continuous functions of transformed coordinates with subsequent analytical integration to compute the pressure-gradient force. This approach allows not only a formally higher order of accuracy, but it also retains and expands several important symmetries of the original second-order scheme to high orders [Mellor et al., 1994; Song, 1998], which is used as a prototype. It also has built-in monotonicity constraining algorithm that prevents appearance of spurious oscillations of polynomial interpolant and, consequently, insures numerical stability and robustness of the model under the conditions of nonsmooth density field and coarse grid resolution. We further incorporate an alternative method of dealing with compressibility of seawater, which escapes pressure-gradient errors associated with interference of the nonlinear nature of equation of state and difficulties to achieve accurate polynomial fits of resultant in situ density profiles. In doing so, we generalized the monotonicity constraint to guarantee nonnegative physical stratification of the reconstructed density profile in the case of compressible equation of state. To verify the new method, we perform traditional idealized (Seamount) and realistic test problems.}},

Traditionally, tides are predicted through harmonic analysis, where a tide level at any time instants is estimated based on the past records. Predicting tide levels based on previously recorded data, strongly suits the application of artificial intelligence models such as neural networks. In the literature, the tide level estimation with neural networks has been mostly considered as a curve-fitting problem. As such, for different beaches different networks have been designed and used. Contrary, in this article, a simple and efficient deep neural network that can estimate future tide levels based on forces and factors affecting the tidal range is proposed. The main advantages of the proposed method are that the input layer can be kept as small as possible, the input data is accessible, and as the input data is based on the main causes of tide, one network can be used for different beaches.}},

The sea surface elevation amplitude of the M2 can vary by 8–10\% and the M4 amplitude by 12–30\% over the course of the year, with larger amplitudes in summer. The annual phase variations are in the range of 3–15°. The reason for these variations is the thermal structure of the North Sea: a well-developed thermocline in summer and well-mixed water column during winter. The interaction of the M2 and M4 tides is one of the main drivers of the residual sediment transport. Using an analytical model, the seasonal variability in residual sediment transport is estimated. This transport can vary by 10–50\% over the course of the year. These variations are mainly related to the seasonal variability of the M2 and M4 amplitudes.}},

The tracking sites, however, are all located on the lithosphere only, and so the network origin will not generally coincide with the center of mass. Changes in the vector offset between these two points, referred to as apparent geocenter motion, are due to global scale movement of mass. In this study we have extended the approach used by space geodetic techniques for determination of tidally coherent nearly diurnal and semidiurnal variations in the Earth's orientation to include geocenter variations due to ocean tides. We demonstrate the weaker observability of nearly diurnal retrograde motions in x and y, and hence the utility of their separation from the other equatorial terms. We find statistically significant terms at the 99.5\% level due to O 1, P 1, K 1, and M 2. The solutions, which indicate geocenter motions at the few millimeter level per tide, compare well with predicted values from theoretical ocean tide models and from TOPEX/Poseidon radar altimetry.}},

In this study, the wave climate of Victoria was analysed using 31 years of directional data hindcast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s WaveWatch-III model (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis hindcasts). An eastward decrease in wave height and period occurs from Portland to Wilson’s Promontory. This trend then reverses on the east coast. Across the west and central coasts, wave direction is dominated by south-west swells as influenced by strong westerly winds and mid-latitude low-pressure systems. On the east coast, wave direction becomes more variable, with added southerly, south-east and easterly components. The Southern Annular Mode influences wave climate variability on the west coast and is negatively correlated with storm frequency and wave direction. On the east coast, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation showed a strong positive correlation with wave height and a negative correlation with direction. This work provides a benchmark to compare to future changes. It will inform a higher-resolution analysis of the spatial correlation of wave conditions with climate processes to predict shoreline response.}},

All three schemes produce globally integrated offline dissipation rates beneath 500-m depth of \textbackslashtextasciitilde0.6–0.8 TW for the M2 constituent, but the spatial structures vary significantly between the parameterizations. Detailed investigations of the energy transfer in local areas confirm the global results: there are large differences between the schemes, although the horizontally integrated conversion rates are similar.

In this paper we use a generalized inverse (GI) approach to compare these data to, and then assimilate them into, numerical models for the barotropic tides. Harmonic analysis of the data in short time windows using a modified admittance approach reveals that tidal currents on the Oregon shelf are highly variable in time, and can contain significant baroclinic components. Data from the winter months, when waters on the shelf are only weakly stratified, are found to be most nearly barotropic and thus most reasonable for assimilation into the shallow water equations model. The various data sources are used in several different combinations for assimilation and validation. Forcing the prior forward model with normal flow open boundary conditions obtained from a regional barotropic inverse model results in semidiurnal barotropic currents that are consistent (within estimated error limits) with all available data. In contrast, diurnal currents on the shelf are very sensitive to details of the model configuration, and are significantly improved by data assimilation. Very similar solutions result from assimilation of either the HF radar or ADP data sets. The high sensitivity of the diurnal band currents can be understood dynamically in terms of trapped shelf waves. A short (\&\#8764;85 km long) section of shelf off the central Oregon coast is wide enough to allow first-mode barotropic shelf waves at the subinertial diurnal frequencies. This results in locally resonant large amplitude diurnal tidal currents that are very sensitive to details in the local forcing, and hence quite variable in time.}},

The state estimate combines most available observations, including all the altimetric missions, with a general circulation model in an optimization procedure. The annual cycle tends to be larger than the semi-annual one, except in tropical regions. For global mean ζ, annual thermosteric and freshwater terms are nearly out-of-phase and lead to an annual cycle of only a few mm in amplitude. Regionally, surface wind stress and heat flux are the primary drivers for seasonal ζ variations in the tropics and midlatitudes, respectively, with both mechanisms playing a role at high latitudes. A substantial part of the annual ζ variability can be assigned to changes in thermosteric height in the upper 100 m in midlatitudes and 200 m in the tropics. Bottom pressure variability is larger at high latitudes, and also in some regions in the Southern Ocean and North Pacific. Apparent nonlinear rectification processes lead to a noticeable impact of submonthly forcing on the annual cycle in the western North Atlantic and North Pacific. Other features include the substantial ζ gradients associated with strong spatial variability in seasonal surface heat flux in some western boundary regions, the damping effects of surface heat flux on the seasonal cycle in the tropics, and the importance of wind driving and bottom pressure in shallow regions, which can cause differences in the seasonal cycle in some coastal and contiguous deep-ocean regions.}},

One of the main deficiencies to use tide gauge data for geodetic sea level research and height systems unification is that only a few stations are connected to the geometric network of a country by operating permanent GNSS receivers next to the tide gauge. As a new observation technique, absolute positioning by SAR using active transponders on ground can fill this gap by systematically observing time series of geometric heights at tide gauge stations. By additionally knowing the tide gauge geoid heights in a global height reference frame, one can finally obtain absolute sea level heights at each tide gauge. With this information the impact of climate change on the sea level can be quantified in an absolute manner and height systems can be connected across the oceans. First results from applying this technique at selected tide gauges at the Baltic coasts are promising but also exhibit some problems related to the new technique. The paper presents the concept of using the new observation type in an integrated sea level observing system and provides some early results for SAR positioning in the Baltic sea area.}},

In this study, we focus on the expansive (∼10,000 km) coastline of Western Australia, a region that experiences large latitudinal gradients in met‐ocean sources of sea level variability, as a case study to investigate the mechanisms responsible for ESLs and trends over the past 54 years (1966–2019). Using long‐term sea level records from tide gauges and satellite altimetry, we explore how different contributions to sea level variability at different time scales (from hourly to interannual) interact to generate ESLs. We observe that all individual, nontidal contributions to ESLs (i.e., atmospheric surge, seasonal and interannual variability) are of similar magnitude (of order 10 cm) along the entire coast and comparable to the tidal variations in the microtidal southwestern region. The results reveal the important role that seasonal and interannual sea level variability plays in generating ESLs, with these low‐frequency contributions being relatively large compared to typical global values. With mean sea level having risen by ∼10 cm over this 54‐year study period, sea level rise was also identified as making an increasingly significant contribution to observed increases in the frequency of ESLs. Overall, due to the comparatively large magnitude of low‐frequency sea level contributions (seasonal and longer), the Western Australia coast provides a useful case study to investigate how sustained periods of elevated sea level will impact coastlines worldwide more broadly in the future.

This has been done from over 4.5 years of data using both response and harmonic analyses. These estimates agree well with each other, and with other gridded models over both long and short wavelengths in deep water, for those tidal components whose alias frequencies are separable by the Rayleigh criterion. Comparisons of along‐track (AT) estimates to current tide models show shorter wavelength features not present in dynamical and empirical global models. AT estimates follow the general trends of empirical models far from sharp topographical changes, but near sharp changes, they tend to follow dynamical model results. Error estimates show that the T/P data are not significantly worse in shallow water than in deep water, suggesting that there is accurate information about tides in shallow water in the T/P data. Tides at crossover locations are improved by computing estimates with both ascending and descending track data. Possible techniques to improve AT tidal estimates between crossover points are discussed. AT tidal estimation can be useful for studying local regions where resolution is more important than regular spacing, for studying tidal interactions over sharp topography, and for extending tidal models from deep to shallow waters through assimilation into a dynamical model.}},

Observational data sets are sparse in time and space and numerical models are unable to predict the timing and location of eddies due to their chaotic nature. Data assimilation combines observations with a numerical model such that the model better represents the observations and provides the dynamic context. This study uses variational methods to quantify how oceanic observations from various platforms impact model estimates of transport and eddy kinetic energy in the East Australia Current. The most influential observations are, in this order, satellite‐derived sea surface temperature; radial components of sea surface velocity from an high‐frequency radar array midway along the coast; satellite‐derived sea surface height, temperature, salinity, and velocity observations from a full‐depth mooring array in the upstream portion of the domain; and subsurface hydrographic data measured by ocean gliders. Not only do the high‐frequency radar observations have high impact on transport estimates at the array location, but also they have significant impact both upstream and downstream. Likewise, the impact of the mooring array observations is far reaching, contributing to transport estimates hundreds of kilometers downstream. The observation impact of deep gliders deployed into eddies is particularly high. Significantly, we find that observations taken in regions with greater natural variability contribute most to constraining the model estimates. Estimating the ocean state requires a combination of numerical modeling and ocean observations. This study quantifies how different observation types and locations contribute to estimates of transport and eddy variability in the East Australian Current. Combining observations with a numerical model of the EAC, we reveal which observations contribute most to changes in the modeled estimate For the metrics used, observations taken in regions with greater natural variability contribute the most Using model physics to compute analysis increments, observation impact is far reaching: upstream and downstream, and forward and backward in time}},

The mode 1 CTW generation, however, occurs farther north than observed, presumably due to insufficient wind data. The mode 1 and observed across-shelf wave structure in the gulf are similar, in that alongshelf currents are nearly depth independent in 100-m water depth, the pressure response is strongest at the coast with decay offshore and with depth, and downwelling occurs over the shelf with the amplitude of the mode 1 density response within a factor of two of the observed response. The main discrepancies between the mode 1 and observed wave structure are that the speed of the mode 1 alongshelf current increases toward the coast while the weakest observed sp...}},

Because they are controlled by Earth's motion relative to other astronomical objects in our solar system, surface tides act like clockwork and generate highly deterministic ebb and flow familiar to all mariners. In contrast, baroclinic motions at tidal frequencies are much more stochastic, owing to complexities in how these internal motions are generated and propagate. Here, we present analysis of current records from continental margins worldwide to illustrate that coastal internal tides are largely unpredictable. This conclusion has numerous implications for coastal processes, as across-shelf exchange and vertical mixing are, in many cases, strongly influenced by the internal wave field.]}},

After introducing observation techniques for waves, both at sea and from space, the book defines the parameters that characterise waves. Using basic statistical and physical concepts, the author discusses the prediction of waves in oceanic and coastal waters, first in terms of generalised observations, and then in terms of the more theoretical framework of the spectral energy balance. He gives the results of established theories and also the direction in which research is developing. The book ends with a description of SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore), the preferred computer model of the engineering community for predicting waves in coastal waters.}},

With some exceptions the non-stationary variance does not exceed 0.25 cm2. The mode-2 signal, where detectable, contains a larger fraction of non-stationary variance, typically 50\% or more.

In understanding why uncertainty is an unavoidable trait of predictions in the first place, a useful concept is the separation of the Earth System (ES) into internal and external components. This separation allows one to first, recognize that for prediction at all time-scales, the inherent source for limits on predictability is due to the divergence of forecasts from a cloud of initial conditions, and second, thereby recognize that the fundamental source of uncertainty (or unpredictability) is limited by our ability to specify initial conditions for the internal component with perfect accuracy.The unavoidability of uncertainty in predictions, and accepting this fact could be advantageous in the ongoing discussions on how to communicate climate projections and the associated uncertainties by learning from the knowledge base that exists for communicating similar information on weather and seasonal predictions that are generated on a much more frequent basis. Similarly, decision-support systems for developing adaptation and mitigation strategies can use predictions on shorter range as a test-bed to hone their strategies to incorporate predictive uncertainty when dealing with longer-range projections. By practicing the use of decision making tools and the incorporation of uncertain predictions on weather and seasonal time scale, decision makers can improve their level of comfort in accepting uncertainty inherent in longer range predictions and projections on a much less infrequent basis. In this paradigm, evolving strategy for seamless predictions can be blended with a strategy for seamless communication of uncertain information and also with seamless application of decision support systems.}},

The MDT may be determined by the ocean approach, which involves temporal averaging of numerical ocean circulation model information, or by the geodetic approach, wherein the MDT is derived using the ellipsoidal height of the mean sea surface (MSS), or mean sea level (MSL) minus the geoid as the geoid. The ellipsoidal height of the MSS might be estimated either by satellite or coastal tide gauges by connecting the tide gauge datum to the Earth-centred reference frame. In this article we present a novel approach to improve the coastal MDT, where the solution is based on both satellite altimetry and tide gauge data using new set of 302 tide gauges with ellipsoidal heights through the SONEL network. The approach was evaluated for the Northeast Atlantic coast where a dense network of GNSS-surveyed tide gauges is available. The typical misfit between tide gauge and satellite or oceanographic MDT was found to be around 9 cm. This misfit was found to be mainly due to small scale geoid errors. Similarly, we found, that a single tide gauge places only weak constraints on the coastal dynamic topography.}},

The most significant global S 2 aliased signal occurs off the northwest coast of Australia in a shallow continental shelf zone, a region with high tidal amplitudes at a period of 161 days. The GRACE S 2 aliased equivalent water height grids are convolved with Green’s functions to produce GRACE aliased tidal loading (GATL) vertical displacements. The analysis of hourly global positioning system (GPS) vertical coordinate estimates at permanent sites in the region confirms the presence of spectral power at the S 2 frequency when the same ocean tide model (FES2004) was used. Thus, deficiencies in the FES2004 ocean tide model are detected both directly and indirectly by the two independent space geodetic techniques. Through simulation, the admittance (ratio of amplitude of spurious long-wavelength output signal in the GRACE time-series to amplitude of unmodeled periodic signals) of the GRACE unmodeled S 2 tidal signals, aliased to a 161-day period, is found to have a global average close to 100\%, although with substantial spatial variation. Comparing GATL with unmodeled S 2 tidal sub-daily signals in the vertical GPS time-series in the region of Broome in NW Australia suggests an admittance of 110–130\%.}},

abstract = {{Ocean tides are changing worldwide for reasons unrelated to astronomical forcing. Changes in tidal properties coupled with altered mean sea level (MSL) may yield higher peak water levels and increased occurrence of short‐term exceedance events, such as storm surge and nuisance flooding. Here we investigate the hypothesis that changes in relative sea level are correlated with alterations in tidal amplitudes. Our approach focuses on the correlation between short‐term (monthly to interannual) fluctuations in sea level with changes in tidal properties of major ocean tides (M2, and K1; S2 and O1) at 152 gauges. Results suggest that sea level variability is correlated to interannual tidal variability at most (92\%) of tide gauges in the Pacific, with statistically significant rates between ±10 and ±500 mm per meter sea level rise observed. These tidal anomalies, while influenced by basin‐scale climate processes and sea level changes, appear to be locally forced (in part) and not coherent over amphidromic or basin‐wide scales. Overall, the Western Pacific shows a greater concentration of tide/sea level correlations at interannual time scales than the Eastern Pacific; 44\% and 46\% of gauges are significant in K1 and O1 in the west compared to 29\% and 30\% in the east, and 63\% and 53\% of gauges in the west are significant in M2 and S2 versus 47\% and 32\% in the east. Seasonal variation in tidal properties is less apparent in the empirical record, with statistically significant seasonal variations observed at only 35\% of all gauges, with the largest concentrations in Southeast Asia. It is common knowledge that sea level are rising worldwide, due to climate change. Less known, and less studied, is the variability of ocean tides that has also been occurring in past decades. Tidal changes are unexpected, since the tides are based on predictable astronomical motions. Nevertheless, these changes are observed worldwide. Sea level changes along with tidal changes, when combined, can have serious implications for future coastal flooding. This study performs a survey of Pacific Ocean tidal variability to understand which regions are experiencing the greatest tidal changes. Tidal change is observed to be correlated to sea level change in the Pacific Ocean, and may be due to a common cause or multiple causes The nonstationarity of tides may amplify flood risk in densely populated coastal areas, particularly in the Western Pacific Accurate diagnosis of increasing tides and rising sea levels is essential to regional coastal planning}},

Hence, the records are too short to investigate inter- and multidecadal variability and their impact on coastal systems. A method is presented to hindcast monthly mid-shelf mean wave direction (MWD) for southeastern Australia, based on the monthly, trans-Tasman mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) difference between northern NSW (Yamba) and the north island of New Zealand (Auckland). The MSLP index is calibrated to instrumental (Waverider buoy) MWD data for the Sydney shelf and coast. Positive/negative trans-Tasman MSLP difference is significantly correlated to southerly/easterly Sydney MWD, and to long/short mean wave periods. The 124-year Sydney annual (MWD) time series displays multidecadal variability, and identifies a significant period of more southerly annual MWD during 1884 to 1914 than in the period since 1915. The Sydney MWD is significantly correlated to the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The correlation with the SOI is enhanced during periods when the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) is in its negative state and warm SST anomalies occur in the southwest Pacific region. The Sydney MWD was found to be associated with Pacific basin-wide climate fluctuations associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Southerly/easterly Sydney MWD is correlated with low/high MSLP anomalies over New Zealand and the central Pacific Ocean. Southerly/easterly Sydney MWD is also correlated with cool/warm SST anomalies in the southwest Pacific, particularly in the eastern Coral Sea and Tasman Sea.

This can lead to coastal inundation happening under benign weather conditions, as flood thresholds are exceeded due to tides alone without the influence of storm surges or other phenomena. As such, changes in frequency of this 'tide-only' inundation may be a useful metric to quantify the role that sea-level rise plays in modulating the risk of coastal inundation from high still water levels. Here we present a conceptual model for 'tide-only' inundation and propose a practical methodology to formulate tide-only inundation statistics: estimates, historical trends, and future projections. This enables this emerging natural hazard to be fully incorporated into new and existing coastal risk assessment frameworks and considered in coastal management and planning strategies at local and national levels. Further, it leads to a framework that can quantify the role that tides play in coastal flooding as sea levels rise.}},

North of 18°N, ∣K1∣ and ∣M2∣ are both growing at 2.2\% century−1. The mean increase in total tidal amplitude (0.59 mmyr−1) is less than the present GSL rise (1.7 mmyr−1). However, mean sea level is nearly constant in the NE Pacific, so tidal evolution plays a major regional role in changes in high water levels. The spatial pattern of tidal evolution suggests the influence of large-scale processes, and the similarity in spatial patterns for ∣K1∣ and ∣M2∣ excludes mechanisms with strong frequency dependence. Increasing tidal amplitudes may impact ocean mixing, nutrient supply, primary production, fisheries, and coastal erosion.}},

abstract = {{Abstract An efficient algorithm has been devised to compute the crossovers in satellite altimetry. The significance of the crossovers is twofold. First they are needed to perform the crossover adjustment to remove the orbit error. Second, they yield important insight to the oceanic variability. Nevertheless, there is no published algorithm to make this very time-consuming task easier, which is the goal of this note. The success of the algorithm is predicated on the ability to predict (by analytical means) the crossover coordinates to within 6 km and 1 sec of the true values. Hence, only one interpolation /extrapolation step on the data is needed to derive the crossover coordinates in contrast to the many interpolation/extrapolation operations that are usually needed to arrive at the same accuracy level if deprived of this information.}},

The character of liquid precipitation (defined as a combination of accumulation, frequency, and intensity) over the global oceans is significantly different from the character of liquid precipitation produced by global weather and climate models. Five different models are used in this comparison representing state-of-the-art weather prediction models, state-of-the-art climate models, and the emerging high-resolution global cloud “resolving” models. The differences between observed and modeled precipitation are larger than can be explained by observational retrieval errors or by the inherent sampling differences between observations and models. We show that the time integrated accumulations of precipitation produced by models closely match observations when globally composited. However, these models produce precipitation approximately twice as often as that observed and make rainfall far too lightly. This finding reinforces similar findings from other studies based on surface accumulated rainfall measurements. The implications of this dreary state of model depiction of the real world are discussed.}},

When the flow is dominated by advection, an unsymmetric zonal wind stress produces a large-scale vortex street. Its constituent vortices have dimensions and particle speed similar to those of mesoscale eddies. The properties of the circulation with free-slip boundary conditions are described and a quantitative relationship with no-slip flows is established.}},

The statistical formulation of the fingerprint scheme suggests new insights into the implementation of the techniques for climate change studies.

A general method, based on the work of Winters and collaborators, is employed for empirically diagnosing an effective diapycnal diffusivity corresponding to any numerical transport process. This method is then used to quantify the spurious mixing engendered by various numerical representations of advection. Both coarse and fine resolution examples are provided that illustrate the importance of adequately resolving the admitted scales of motion in order to maintain a small amount of mixing consistent with that measured within the ocean’s pycnocline. Such resolution depends on details of the advection scheme, momentum and tracer dissipation, and grid resolution. Vertical transport processes, such as convective adjustment, act as yet another means to increase the spurious mixing introduced by dispersive errors from numerical advective fluxes.}},

Such long time series allow us to determine the semidiurnal tidal component very accurately, while resolving the aliasing problems, at least for the main tidal wave M2. As already inferred by other authors, this along-track analysis detects the surface signatures of the internal tides signal that maintains coherence with the M2 astronomical forcing. By analyzing the T/P data in different periods of 3 years or more, the stability of the M2 tidal characteristics is demonstrated for the barotropic component as well as for the baroclinic signal observed in the altimetric data. This stability varies with location. For the barotropic component the dispersion of the results as a function of the length and period of analysis is only significant over the areas of ocean mesoscale activity (noise impact) and of large barotropic tidal signal (separating the different components of the tidal signal proves difficult). The baroclinic tidal signal appears to be surprisingly stable over many areas located around strong topographic gradients like submarine ridges. A methodology has been developed to draw a map of these areas. This can be of help for ocean modelers to specify areas of higher vertical mixing associated with internal tidal wave activity and for those who assimilate altimetric data in their models by giving guidance on where to increase the uncertainty of the altimeter data over these areas.}},

abstract = {{Keysers, J.H.; Quadros, N.D., and Collier, P.A., 2015. Vertical datum transformations across the Australian littoral zone.There is a growing demand in Australia for better information to assess the risks associated with sea-level rise and coastal inundation. Seamless elevation data across the littoral zone is an essential requirement for the assessment of coastal risks and the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies. Seamless coastal data products require the integration of topographic data with offshore bathymetric data. A prerequisite for the integration process is that the respective elevation data sets be related to the same vertical datum. This article discusses the development of a vertical datum transformation approach to facilitate the creation of seamless elevation data sets across the Australian littoral zone, with a focus on the challenges unique to Australia. Review of international projects, research into the relevant concepts, and an investigation of the data sets available in Australia led to the adoption of an ellipsoid-based transformation approach. Mean sea-level heights related to the ellipsoid and derived from coastal tide gauges were used to enhance a satellite altimetry–derived mean sea surface. Other tidal datums were modelled through hydrodynamic modelling, and the Australian Height Datum was achieved via Australia's current geoid model: AUSGeoid09. Although a transformation procedure has been developed, the current status and availability of Australian tide gauge data prevent the production of a suitably accurate and reliable vertical datum transformation software tool that provides full coverage of the Australian coast. To produce such a tool, Australia requires the collation of existing tide gauge data and metadata, a repository to store that data, an ellipsoid height survey of all tide gauges, and a denser network of tide gauges.}},

This has motivated a number of authors to search for already existing accelerations in observations, which would be, if present, vital for coastal protection planning purposes. No scientific consensus has been reached yet as to how a possible acceleration could be separated from intrinsic climate variability in sea level records. This has led to an intensive debate on its existence and, if absent, also on the general validity of current future projections. Here we shed light on the controversial discussion from a methodological point of view. To do so, we provide a comprehensive review of trend methods used in the community so far. This resulted in an overview of 30 methods, each having its individual mathematical formulation, flexibilities, and characteristics. We illustrate that varying trend approaches may lead to contradictory acceleration‐deceleration inferences. As for statistics‐oriented trend methods, we argue that checks on model assumptions and model selection techniques yield a way out. However, since these selection methods all have implicit assumptions, we show that good modeling practices are of importance too. We conclude at this point that (i) several differently characterized methods should be applied and discussed simultaneously, (ii) uncertainties should be taken into account to prevent biased or wrong conclusions, and (iii) removing internally generated climate variability by incorporating atmospheric or oceanographic information helps to uncover externally forced climate change signals. A review is given of 30 trend models applied in the field of sea level research Varying trend patterns can be found for the same data depending on the method chosen Contradictory trend inferences can be avoided by applying good modeling practices}},

The computed M2 amplitudes and phases are tabulated along with all specially labeled empirical input data on a 1° × 1 ° grid system in 42° × 71° overlapping charts covering the whole oceanic globe. Corresponding global and arctic corange and cotidal maps are included to provide a quick overview of the major tidal phenomena. Significant qualitative and quantitative features are explained and discussed for proper application. In particular, the charted harmonic constants may be used to compute instantaneous M2 ocean tides with an accuracy of better than 5 cm any time and anywhere in the open oceans.

Tide models under review include empirical, purely hydrodynamic (“forward”), and assimilative dynamical, i.e., constrained by observations. Ten dominant tidal constituents in the diurnal, semidiurnal, and quarter-diurnal bands are considered. Since the last major model comparison project in 1997, models have improved markedly, especially in shallow-water regions and also in the deep ocean. The root-sum-square differences between tide observations and the best models for eight major constituents are approximately 0.9, 5.0, and 6.5 cm for pelagic, shelf, and coastal conditions, respectively. Large intermodel discrepancies occur in high latitudes, but testing in those regions is impeded by the paucity of high-quality in situ tide records. Long-wavelength components of models tested by analyzing satellite laser ranging measurements suggest that several models are comparably accurate for use in precise orbit determination, but analyses of GRACE intersatellite ranging data show that all models are still imperfect on basin and subbasin scales, especially near Antarctica. For the M2 constituent, errors in purely hydrodynamic models are now almost comparable to the 1980-era Schwiderski empirical solution, indicating marked advancement in dynamical modeling. Assessing model accuracy using tidal currents remains problematic owing to uncertainties in in situ current meter estimates and the inability to isolate the barotropic mode. Velocity tests against both acoustic tomography and current meters do confirm that assimilative models perform better than purely hydrodynamic models.}},

The statistical prediction is based on a regression relation between the “storm maximum” storm surge and the storm composite significant wave height predicted ata nearby location. The use of the statistical surge prediction as an alternative bias correction for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operational storm surge forecasts is shownhere to be statistically equivalent to the existing bias correctiontechnique and potentially applicable for much longer forecast lead times as well as for storm surge climate prediction. Applying the statistical model to locations along the east coast shows that the regression relation can be “trained” with data from tide gauge measurements and near-shore buoys along the coast from North Carolina to Maine, and that it provides accurate estimates of storm surge.}},

A compilation of all predicted nuisance-flooding events, induced by astronomical tides alone, is presented through year 2050. The accuracy of the tide prediction is improved when several unusual properties of Gulf of Maine tides, including secular changes, are properly accounted for. Future mean sea-level rise at Boston cannot be predicted with comparable confidence, so two very different climate scenarios are adopted; both predict a large increase in the frequency and the magnitude of tidal flooding events.}},

abstract = {{This paper examines the accuracy of surface elevations in a forward global numerical model of 10 tidal constituents. Both one-layer and two-layer simulations are performed. As far as the authors are aware, the two-layer simulations and the simulations in a companion paper (Deep-Sea Research II, 51 (2004) 3043) represent the first published global numerical solutions for baroclinic tides. Self-consistent forward solutions for the global tide are achieved with a convergent iteration procedure for the self-attraction and loading term. Energies are too large, and elevation accuracies are poor, unless substantial abyssal drag is present. Reasonably accurate tidal elevations can be obtained with a spatially uniform bulk drag c d or horizontal viscosity K H , but only if these are inordinately large. More plausible schemes concentrate drag over rough topography. The topographic drag scheme used here is based on an exact analytical solution for arbitrary small-amplitude terrain, and supplemented by dimensional analysis to account for drag due to flow-splitting and low-level turbulence as well as that due to breaking of radiating waves. The scheme is augmented by a multiplicative factor tuned to minimize elevation discrepancies with respect to the TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P)-constrained GOT99.2 model. The multiplicative factor may account for undersampled small spatial scales in bathymetric datasets. An optimally tuned multi-constituent one-layer simulation has an RMS elevation discrepancy of 9.54 cm with respect to GOT99.2, in waters deeper than 1000 m and over latitudes covered by T/P (66 ∘ N to 66 ∘ S). The surface elevation discrepancy decreases to 8.90 cm (92 percent of the height variance captured) in the optimally tuned two-layer solution. The improvement in accuracy is not due to the direct surface elevation signature of internal tides, which is of small amplitude, but to a shift in the barotropic tide induced by baroclinicity. Elevations are also more accurate in the two-layer model when pelagic tide gauges are used as the benchmark, and when the T/P-constrained TPXO6.2 model is used as a benchmark in deep waters south of 66 ∘ S. For Antarctic diurnal tides, the improvement in forward model elevation accuracy with baroclinicity is substantial. The optimal multiplicative factor in the two-layer case is nearly the same as in the one-layer case, against initial expectations that the explicit resolution of low-mode conversion would allow less parameterized drag. In the optimally tuned two-layer M 2 solution, local values of the ratio of temporally averaged squared upper layer speed to squared lower layer speed often exceed 10.}},

Impact-based thresholds may also provide a basis for the development of meaningful coastal flood warnings, forecasts and monitoring in the future. These services will become increasingly important as sea-level rise continues.The frequency of high sea-level events leading to coastal flooding increased at all 21 locations where impact-based thresholds were defined. Although we did not undertake a formal attribution, this increase was consistent with the well-documented rise in global sea levels. Notably, tide gauges from the south coast of Queensland showed that frequent coastal inundation was already occurring. At Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, impact-based thresholds were being exceeded on average 21.6 and 24.3 h per year respectively. In the case of Brisbane, the number of hours of inundation annually has increased fourfold since 1977.}},

We present a novel global dataset of extreme sea levels, the Coastal Dataset for the Evaluation of Climate Impact (CoDEC), which can be used to accurately map the impact of climate change on coastal regions around the world. The third generation Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM), with a coastal resolution of 2.5 km (1.25 km in Europe), was used to simulate extreme sea levels for the ERA5 climate reanalysis from 1979 to 2017, as well as for future climate scenarios from 2040 to 2100. The validation against observed sea levels demonstrated a good performance, and the annual maxima had a mean bias (MB) of -0.04 m, which is 50\% lower than the MB of the previous GTSR dataset. By the end of the century (2071–2100), it is projected that the 1 in 10-year water levels will have increased 0.34 m on average for RCP4.5, while some locations may experience increases of up to 0.5 m. The change in return levels is largely driven by SLR, although at some locations changes in storms surges and interaction with tides amplify the impact of SLR with changes up to 0.2 m. By presenting an application of the CoDEC dataset to the city of Copenhagen, we demonstrate how climate impact indicators derived from simulation can contribute to an understanding of climate impact on a local scale. Moreover, the CoDEC output locations are designed to be used as boundary conditions for regional models, and we envisage that they will be used for dynamic downscaling.}},

Although most ensemble members—initialized with realistic initial condition uncertainties smaller than the NCEP Global Forecast System Final Analysis (GFS FNL) using an ensemble Kalman filter—forecast broad areas of severe convection, there is a large variability of forecast performance among different members, highlighting the limit of practical predictability. In general, the best-performing members tend to have a stronger upper-level trough and associated surface low, producing a more conducive environment for strong long-lived squall lines and bow echoes, once triggered.

We compute SAL modifications as an additional force on the water masses at every time step by decomposing the field of ocean bottom pressure anomalies into spherical harmonic functions and then applying Love numbers to account for the elastic properties of the solid Earth. Considering SAL in the postprocessing turns out to be insufficient, especially in coastal waters and on subweekly time scales, where SAL modifies local sea level by around 0.6–0.8 cm on average; in the open ocean, changes mostly remain around 0.3 cm. Modifications of water velocities as well as of heat and salt distributions are modeled, yet they are small. Simple parameterizations of SAL effects currently used in a number of ocean circulation models suffer from the process's inhomogeneity in space and time. These parameterizations improve the modeled sea level patterns but fail to reproduce SAL impacts on circulation and density distributions. We therefore suggest to explicitly consider the full SAL effect in ocean circulation models, especially when investigating sea level variations faster than around 4 days.}},

The root-mean-squared errors are about 0.12 m for water level, less than 1.5 °C for temperature, less than 1.5 psu for salinity, and less than 0.2 m/s for currents. It is anticipated to complete the system development and the transition into operations in fiscal year 2017.}},

Pictures and pulses—I want to know where they came from, how pictures and counts got to be the bottom-line data of physics." (from the preface) Image and Logic is the most detailed engagement to date with the impact of modern technology on what it means to "do" physics and to be a physicist. At the beginning of this century, physics was usually done by a lone researcher who put together experimental apparatus on a benchtop. Now experiments frequently are larger than a city block, and experimental physicists live very different lives: programming computers, working with industry, coordinating vast teams of scientists and engineers, and playing politics. Peter L. Galison probes the material culture of experimental microphysics to reveal how the ever-increasing scale and complexity of apparatus have distanced physicists from the very science that drew them into experimenting, and have fragmented microphysics into different technical traditions much as apparatus have fragmented atoms to get at the fundamental building blocks of matter. At the same time, the necessity for teamwork in operating multimillion-dollar machines has created dynamic "trading zones," where instrument makers, theorists, and experimentalists meet, share knowledge, and coordinate the extraordinarily diverse pieces of the culture of modern microphysics: work, machines, evidence, and argument.}},

Scientists and engineers need to understand the interaction of surges with the tide in order to provide better estimates of extreme sea level for use in coastal defense. Using data from five tide gauges, spaced equally along the North Sea coastline around the UK, we show that the mode of peak residual occurrence is everywhere 3 to 5 hours before the nearest high water. We reveal a previously unobserved mode that falls 1 to 2 hours prior to high water, although this cluster is not associated with the highest residuals. A simple mathematical explanation for surge clustering on the rising tide is presented. The phase shift of the tidal signal is combined with the modulation of surge production due to water depth in a model that provides a good description of the residual data set. The results contain several features of interest for flood risk management. We show that large, locally generated surges are precluded close to high water. For physically realistic arrival times of any travelling surge component, the residual peak will avoid high water for any finite tidal phase shift. Furthermore, increasing the tidal range reduces the risk of residual peaks near high water. We draw attention to the existence of critical time and space scales for surge development and decay. For reliable operational forecasts of sea level, coastal numerical models need to reproduce both tides and surges with improved accuracy.}},

To form accurate tidal predictions using the method of harmonic analysis, long-term sea level registrations have to be collected and analysed. This article presents an alternative approach to the task of tidal forecasts based on the application of harmonic analysis and back-propagation, artificial neural networks to short-term measurements. Sea level records from the Hillarys Boat Harbour tide gauge, Western Australia, are used to implement this original methodology and to test its performance. The results of the methodology validation show that short-term sea level registrations can be effi-ciently employed to produce accurate tidal predictions.}},

Upwelling is eventually terminated due to the reversal of winds associated with the onset of the northwest monsoon and impingement of Indian Ocean equatorial Kelvin waves. Significant interannual variability of the Java\&\#8208;Sumatra upwelling is linked to ENSO through the Indonesian throughflow (ITF) and by anomalous easterly wind. During El Niño episodes, the Java\&\#8208;Sumatra upwelling extends in both time (into November) and space (closer to the equator). During El Nino (La Niña), the ITF carries colder (warmer) water shallowing (deepening) thermocline depth and enhancing (reducing) upwelling strength.}},

It is a natural approach; however, it implicitly neglects non-linearities of ocean dynamics. An alternative approach is time-domain modeling with a forcing given by the full lunisolar potential, i.e., all tidal waves are a priori included. This approach has been applied in several ocean tide models; however, some challenging tasks still remain, for example, assimilation of satellite altimetry data. In this paper, we introduce the assimilative scheme applicable in a time-domain model, which is an alternative to existing techniques used in assimilative ocean tide models. We present results from DEBOT, a global barotropic ocean tide model, which has two modes: DEBOT-h, a purely hydrodynamical mode, and DEBOT-a, an assimilative mode. The accuracy of DEBOT in both modes is assessed through a series of tests against tide gauge data which demonstrate that DEBOT is comparable to state-of-the-art global ocean tide models for major tidal constituents. Furthermore, as signals of all tidal frequencies are included in DEBOT, we also discuss modeling of minor tidal constituents and non-linear compound tides. Our modeling approach can be useful for those applications where the frequency domain approach is not suitable.}},

In particular, total sea levels at the coast are hard to measure with current techniques. Sea level is commonly measured with tidal gauges and spaceborne altimetry, which lack essential details of spatial and wave-related sea level variability along the coast. Hence, novel techniques, adapted to nearshore areas, are required. This paper presents the first-time use of video cameras to derive the total sea level at the coast. This novel approach consists of estimating time-varying total water levels by applying a celerity-based depth inversion method, which is conventionally used to estimate bathymetry from video. The video-derived total sea levels are compared to sea levels derived from an in-situ ADCP, the nearest tide gauge, and altimetry. A tidal harmonic analysis is performed on the video-derived water levels, yielding an accurate determination of the dominant tidal harmonics. However, it remains difficult to separate bathymetric changes due to the waves on beaches when rapid morphological changes occur under energetic conditions. Nonetheless, video-derived water level anomalies are in good agreement with state-of-the-art altimetry products. Although there is still work to be done, the results show the potential to measure total sea level at the coast using video camera systems.}},

Regional models cannot run alone and have to use large area or global models to provide boundary wave spectra. The modern two-way nesting technique is to run the two models together with the regional model domain covered by both resolutions. An alternative method is to use a single multi-resolution grid that fits irregular coastlines and provides refined resolutions in selected regions. This paper presents a multi-resolution model based on a spherical multiple-cell (SMC) grid, which is designed to relax the CFL restriction of Eulerian advection time step at high latitudes by merging the conventional latitude-longitude grid cells. The implementation of the SMC grid in WAVEWATCH III is described, and a multi-resolution (6, 12 and 25 km) global SMC configuration is compared with a suite of nested grid ocean surface wave models, including 35-km global, 8-km European and 4-km UK regional models. Verification against buoy and platform wave observations indicates that the unified model is better than the 35-km global and very close in performance to the two regional models.}},

abstract = {{Coastal zones are highly dynamical systems affected by a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcing factors that include sea level rise, extreme events, local oceanic and atmospheric processes, ground subsidence, etc. However, so far, they remain poorly monitored on a global scale. To better understand changes affecting world coastal zones and to provide crucial information to decision-makers involved in adaptation to and mitigation of environmental risks, coastal observations of various types need to be collected and analyzed. In this white paper, we first discuss the main forcing agents acting on coastal regions (e.g., sea level, winds, waves and currents, river runoff, sediment supply and transport, vertical land motions, land use) and the induced coastal response (e.g., shoreline position, estuaries morphology, land topography at the land–sea interface and coastal bathymetry). We identify a number of space-based observational needs that have to be addressed in the near future to understand coastal zone evolution. Among these, improved monitoring of coastal sea level by satellite altimetry techniques is recognized as high priority. Classical altimeter data in the coastal zone are adversely affected by land contamination with degraded range and geophysical corrections. However, recent progress in coastal altimetry data processing and multi-sensor data synergy, offers new perspective to measure sea level change very close to the coast. This issue is discussed in much detail in this paper, including the development of a global coastal sea-level and sea state climate record with mission consistent coastal processing and products dedicated to coastal regimes. Finally, we present a new promising technology based on the use of Signals of Opportunity (SoOp), i.e., communication satellite transmissions that are reutilized as illumination sources in a bistatic radar configuration, for measuring coastal sea level. Since SoOp technology requires only receiver technology to be placed in orbit, small satellite platforms could be used, enabling a constellation to achieve high spatio-temporal resolutions of sea level in coastal zones.}},

They form one infinite discrete sequence of modes with frequencies decreasing to zero. The mode frequencies increase with stratification. All modes progress with the coast on their right in the Northern Hemisphere. In three formal asymptotic limits the waves adopt special forms: (1) large longshore wavenumber [Rhines (1970) bottom–trapped waves]; (2) small stratification [barotropic continental shelf waves]; and (3) large stratification [baroclinic (internal) Kelvin-like waves]. These results are illustrated by numerical calculations using the method of inverse iteration, which avoids time integration. Further calculations demonstrate the strong influence of the depth and density profiles on the wave forms.

abstract = {{The main objective of the LAgrangian Transport EXperiment (LATEX) project was to study the influence of coastal mesoscale and submesoscale physical processes on circulation dynamics, cross-shelf exchanges, and biogeochemistry in the western continental shelf of the Gulf of Lion, Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. LATEX was a five-year multidisciplinary project based on the combined analysis of numerical model simulations and multi-platform field experiments. The model component included a ten-year realistic 3D numerical simulation, with a 1 km horizontal resolution over the gulf, nested in a coarser 3 km resolution model. The in situ component involved four cruises, including a large-scale multidisciplinary campaign with two research vessels in 2010. This review concentrates on the physics results of LATEX, addressing three main subjects: (1) the investigation of the mesoscale to submesoscale processes. The eddies are elliptic, baroclinic, and anticyclonic; the strong thermal and saline front is density compensated. Their generation processes are studied; (2) the development of sampling strategies for their direct observations. LATEX has implemented an adaptive strategy Lagrangian tool, with a reference software available on the web, to perform offshore campaigns in a Lagrangian framework; (3) the quantification of horizontal mixing and cross-shelf exchanges. Lateral diffusivity coefficients, calculated in various ways including a novel technique, are in the range classically encountered for their associated scales. Cross-shelf fluxes have been calculated, after retrieving the near-inertial oscillation contribution. Further perspectives are discussed, especially for the ongoing challenge of studying submesoscale features remotely and from in situ data.}},

This process is known as the Garden Sprinkler Effect (GSE). An existing solution to the GSE consists of adding a diffusion tensor to the propagation equation. Although this diffusion method has been proven successful, it is prohibitively expensive for models with high spatial resolution. Two alternatives are presented here. The first is an averaging method. It shares characteristics with the diffusion method, but is much cheaper for high resolution models. The second method consists of adding divergence to the advection field. This divergence method is shown to be accurate for idealized conditions, and requires less tuning, but is still too expensive to replace the other methods in practical conditions. It is therefore suggested to replace the diffusion method with an averaging method in operational models, and to investigate the divergence method further.}},

Sea level variability occurs on all timescales, with processes at higher frequencies tending to have a larger magnitude at the coast due to resonance and other dynamics. In the case of some processes, such as the tides, the presence of the coast and the shallow waters of the shelves results in the processes being considerably more complex than offshore. However, ‘coastal variability’ should not always be considered as ‘short spatial scale variability’ but can be the result of signals transmitted along the coast from 1000s km away. Fortunately, thanks to tide gauges being necessarily located at the coast, many aspects of coastal sea level variability can be claimed to be better understood than those in the deep ocean. Nevertheless, certain aspects of coastal variability remain under-researched, including how changes in some processes (e.g., wave setup, river runoff) may have contributed to the historical mean sea level records obtained from tide gauges which are now used routinely in large-scale climate research.}},

The usual two-dimensional problem is reduced to a one-dimensional integral equation across the shelf. The structure of the problem depends on the strength of the stratification measured by the parameter B = NoD/fL for typical buoyancy frequency No, depth D, Coriolis parameter f, and shelf width L. Asymptotic approximations are given for both strong (B≫1) and weak (B ≪ 1) stratification, and attempts are made to provide analytical expressions for the phase speeds over the whole range of B using Padé approximations. These compare well with the numerical results. Examples are given using a number of different topographies and the conditions for which mode kissing between baroclinic and barotropic wave modes occur are discussed.

Here we assess our current understanding of the causes of coastal SL variability on monthly to multi-decadal timescales, including geodetic, oceanographic and atmospheric aspects of the problem, and review available observing systems informing on coastal SL.

Numerical models can support flood prevention and planning for coastal communities. However, while recent advancements in the development of numerical models for storm surge prediction have led to robust and accurate models; an increasing number of parameters and physical processes’ representations are available to modelers and engineers. This study investigates uncertainties associated with the selection of physical parameters or processes involved in storm surge modeling in large estuaries. Specifically, we explored the sensitivity of a hydrodynamic model (ADCIRC) and a coupled wind-wave and circulation model system (ADCIRC + SWAN) to Manning’s n coefficient, wind waves and circulation interaction (wave setup), minimum depth (H0) in the wetting and drying algorithm, and spatially constant horizontal eddy viscosity (ESLM) forced by tides and hurricane winds. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis to Manning’s n coefficient and the interaction of waves and circulation were analyzed by using three different numerical meshes. Manning’s coefficient analysis was divided into waterway (rivers, bay and shore, and open ocean) and overland. Overall, the rivers exhibited a larger sensitivity, and M2 amplitude and maximum water elevations were reduced by 0.20 m and 0.56 m, respectively, by using a high friction value; similarly, high friction reduced maximum water levels up to 0.30 m in overland areas; the wave setup depended on the offshore wave height, angle of breaking, the profile morphology, and the mesh resolution, accounting for up to 0.19 m setup inside the bay; minimum depth analysis showed that H0 = 0.01 added an artificial mass of water in marshes and channels, meanwhile H = 0.1 partially solved this problem; and the eddy viscosity study demonstrated that the ESLM = 40 values reduced up to 0.40 m the peak of the maximum water levels in the upper side of narrow rivers.}},

It was found that low-frequency sea level anomalies (SLAs) were continuously propagating from the south coast up along the east coast as CTWs, mainly forced by the alongshore wind stress. Three main subinertial peaks existed in the spectral characteristics of the SLAs, with periods of 14.2, 10.2, and 7.8 days, respectively. Power spectral density distributions of the peaks showed that the CTW amplitudes varied significantly along the southeast coast. For idealized linear and exponential shelves, a theoretical analysis indicated that the fundamental factor influencing the eigenvector of mode 1, and therefore the CTW amplitude, was the offshore water depth. This theoretical work was well supported by eight sensitivity cases. Four additional cases were conducted, and time-averaged energy fluxes were calculated to identify the energy source of the CTWs in the Austr...}},

The coastal influence of open-ocean dynamics (dynamics associated with forcing which occurs in deep water, beyond the continental slope) therefore involves a hand-over between the predominantly geostrophic dynamics of the interior ocean and the ageostrophic dynamics which must occur at the coast. An understanding of how this hand-over occurs can be obtained by considering the combined role of coastal trapped waves and bottom friction. We here review understanding of coastal trapped waves, which propagate cyclonically around ocean basins along the continental shelf and slope, at speeds which are fast compared to those of baroclinic planetary waves and currents in the open ocean (excluding the large-scale barotropic mode). We show that this results in coastal sea-level signals on western boundaries which, compared to the nearby open-ocean signals, are spatially smoothed, reduced in amplitude, and displaced along the coast in the direction of propagation of coastal trapped waves. The open-ocean influence on eastern boundaries is limited to signals propagating polewards from the equatorial waveguide (although a large-scale diffusive influence may also play a role). This body of work is based on linearised equations, but we also discuss the nonlinear case. We suggest that a proper consideration of nonlinear terms may be very important on western boundaries, as the competition between advection by western boundary currents and a counter-propagating influence of coastal trapped waves has the potential to lead to sharp gradients in coastal sea level where the two effects come into balance.}},

Vertical variations in the pressure gradient are expressed in terms of a vertical integral of the Jacobian of density and depth with respect to the vertical computational coordinate. Finite difference approximations are made on the density field, consistent with piecewise linear and continuous fields, and accurate pressure gradients are obtained by vertically integrating the discrete Jacobian from sea surface. Two discrete schemes are derived and examined in detail: the first using standard centered differencing in the generalized vertical coordinate and the second using a vertical weighting such that the finite differences are centered with respect to the Cartesian z coordinate. Both schemes achieve second-order accuracy for any vertical coordinate system and are significantly more a...}},

Typically, the effects of across-shelf winds are ignored because transport in the surface Ekman layer parallel to winds is assumed zero. Recent studies, however, have shown that the traditional view of across-shelf transport breaks down in shallow waters where friction is important. In this study, a series of two-dimensional simulations is used to show that across-shelf winds can result in across-shelf velocities in the upper few meters of the water column that are similar in magnitude to those generated by alongshelf winds. This circulation has important consequences for the transport of surface-dwelling material, such as blue crab larvae off of Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. The effects of both alongshelf and across-shelf winds on simulated surface dwelling tracer patches are examined. T...}},

The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theo- retical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmöller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described.The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Niño3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscilla- tion index show significantly higher power during 1880–1920 and 1960–90, and lower power during 1920–60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovmöller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2–8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.}},

abstract = {{The probability of extreme storm-tide events has been extensively studied; however, the variability within the duration of such events and implications to flood risk is less well understood. This research quantifies such variability during extreme storm-tide events (the combined elevation of the tide, surge, and their interactions) at 44 national tide gauges around the UK. Extreme storm-tide events were sampled from water level measurements taken every 15 min between 1993 and 2012. At each site, the variability in elevation at each time step, relative to a given event peak, was quantified. The magnitude of this time series variability was influenced both by gauge location (and hence the tidal and nontidal residual characteristics) and the time relative to high water. The potential influence of this variability on coastal inundation was assessed across all UK gauge sites, followed by a detailed case study of Portsmouth. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the Portsmouth region was used to demonstrate that given a current 1 in 200 year storm-tide event, the predicted number of buildings inundated differed by more than 30\% when contrasting simulations forced with the upper and lower bounds of the observed time series variability. The results indicate that variability in the time series of the storm-tide event can have considerable influence upon overflow volumes, hence with implications for coastal flood risk assessments. Therefore, further evaluating and representing this uncertainty in future flood risk assessments is vital, while the envelopes of variability defined in this research provides a valuable tool for coastal flood modelers.}},

abstract = {{The Dvorak technique is used operationally by meteorological agencies throughout the world for estimating tropical cyclone intensity and position. The technique consists of constraints that put a maximum threshold for which the Final T-number, relating directly to intensity, can change during a certain time interval (6-hr, 12-hr, 18-hr, and 24-hr). There are cases when these constraints could be broken, especially during rapid intensification. This research tests whether the constraints used for intensity change are warranted or need to be changed. A database of cases with the largest intensity changes for 2000-2017 Atlantic tropical cyclones was compiled. A reconnaissance or scatterometer “fix” is required within three hours of both the beginning and ending of the period for each case to inform the best track and to be included for analysis. Dvorak classifications from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch are noted for each case, which includes the initial and Final T-numbers, Current Intensity numbers, and Data-T numbers. Statistical parameters, including correlations, intensity errors, absolute intensity errors, root-mean-square errors, and significance tests are calculated and analyzed for each period. Results suggest that the T-number constraints for the 18-hr and 24-hr periods could be increased to a 2.5 and a 3.0, respectively. However, results also suggest that the constraints for the 6-hr and 12-hr time intervals should remain the same.}}

Through a series of ideal experiments, practical application at two tidal gauges and comparison with the traditional HA, the feasibility and accuracy of the two-step HA are verified: The two-step HA performs better than the traditional HA in estimating monthly amplitudes and phases for the predominant constituents, whether they have seasonal variability or not. In addition to capturing variations of the predominant constituents at tidal gauges, the two-step HA would be useful in investigation of the coherence and incoherence of internal tides.}},

abstract = {{Many physical processes are an amalgam of components operating on different scales, and scientific questions about observed data are often inherently linked to understanding the behavior at different scales. We explore time-scale properties of time series through the variance at different scales derived using wavelet methods. The great advantage of wavelet methods over ad hoc modifications of existing techniques is that wavelets provide exact scale-based decomposition results. We consider processes that are stationary, nonstationary but with stationary dth order differences, and nonstationary but with local stationarity. We study an estimator of the wavelet variance based on the maximal-overlap (undecimated) discrete wavelet transform. The asymptotic distribution of this wavelet variance estimator is derived for a wide class of stochastic processes, not necessarily Gaussian or linear. The variance of this distribution is estimated using spectral methods. Simulations confirm the theoretical results. The utility of the methodology is demonstrated on two scientifically important series, the surface albedo of pack ice (a strongly non-Gaussian series) and ocean shear data (a nonstationary series).}},

abstract = {{In most places extreme high tides undergo a clear seasonal variation. It is well known that semidiurnal tides tend to peak during equinox seasons, and diurnals during solstice seasons. This is a consequence of the solar and lunar declinations, which when large maximize diurnal tides at the expense of semidiurnals. The semiannual range modulation of tidal extremes for a pure semidiurnal tide is determined mainly by the amplitude of the K2 constituent; a pure diurnal is determined mainly by P1. Mixed tidal regimes tend to experience maxima very roughly around the times of solstice, but not always, with the semiannual modulation generally a complicated function of constituent amplitudes and phases. These modulations are here mapped worldwide by analyzing tidal extremes predicted with a global tide model. The known 4.4‐year modulation in extreme tides is a consequence of declinational and perigean effects coming in and out of phase. The phase of the 4.4‐year modulation is controlled by the phase of the semiannual modulation, irrespective of whether the tide is diurnal, semidiurnal, or mixed. Range and timing of semiannual and 4.4‐year modulations in extreme high tides are mapped globally Semiannual phase is trivial for purely diurnal or semidiurnal tides but otherwise is complicated function of constituent amplitudes/phases The phase of the semiannual modulation controls the phase of the 4.4‐year modulation}},

From 1972 to 2008, the observed sea-level rise (1.8 ± 0.2 mm yr−1 from tide gauges alone and 2.1 ± 0.2 mm yr−1 from a combination of tide gauges and altimeter observations) agrees well with the sum of contributions (1.8 ± 0.4 mm yr−1) in magnitude and with both having similar increases in the rate of rise during the period. The largest contributions come from ocean thermal expansion (0.8 mm yr−1) and the melting of glaciers and ice caps (0.7 mm yr−1), with Greenland and Antarctica contributing about 0.4 mm yr−1. The cryospheric contributions increase through the period (particularly in the 1990s) but the thermosteric contribution increases less rapidly. We include an improved estimate of aquifer depletion (0.3 mm yr−1), partially offsetting the retention of water in dams and giving a total terrestrial storage contribution of −0.1 mm yr−1. Ocean warming (90\% of the total of the Earth's energy increase) continues through to the end of the record, in agreement with continued greenhouse gas forcing. The aerosol forcing, inferred as a residual in the atmospheric energy balance, is estimated as −0.8 ± 0.4 W m−2 for the 1980s and early 1990s. It increases in the late 1990s, as is required for consistency with little surface warming over the last decade. This increase is likely at least partially related to substantial increases in aerosol emissions from developing nations and moderate volcanic activity.}},

To help overcome some of these deficiencies, a diabatic nudging scheme has been developed for the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre (BMRC) limited-area tropical prediction system. A target analysis for the nudging is first obtained from statistical interpolation of all observational data, using, as first-guess field, output from a global assimilation and prediction system. Tropical cyclones are optionally inserted via bogus wind observations. From 12 or 24 h prior to the base time of the forecast, the prediction model is nudged toward the target analysis. During nudging the “observationally reliable” rotational wind component is preserved and the heating from the Kuo sche...}},

The new solution is characterized by reduced errors in shallow waters compared to the other two models recently developed; CSR4.0 model (improved version of Eanes and Bettadpur, 1994) and GOT99.2b model (Ray, 1999), which are demonstrated in comparison with tide gauge data and collinear residual reduction test. This property mainly benefits from fine-scale along-track tidal analysis of TOPEX/POSEIDON data. A high-resolution (1/12°) regional ocean tide model around Japan (NAO.99Jb model) by assimilating both TOPEX/POSEIDON data and 219 coastal tide gauge data is also developed. A comparison with 80 independent coastal tide gauge data shows the better performance of NAO.99Jb model in the coastal region compared with the other global models. Tidal dissipation around Japan has been investigated for M 2 and K 1 constituents by using NAO.99Jb model. The result suggests that the tidal energy is mainly dissipated by bottom friction in localized area in shallow seas; the M 2 ocean tidal energy is mainly dissipated in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea at the mean rate of 155 GW, while the K 1 energy is mainly dissipated in the Sea of Okhotsk at the mean rate of 89 GW. TOPEX/POSEIDON data, however, detects broadly distributed surface manifestation of M 2 internal tide, which observationally suggests that the tidal energy is also dissipated by the energy conversion into baroclinic tide.}},

This may be due to the difficulty in applying common tests given the spatial correlation of and non-normality of errors. Possible ways around these difficulties are explored here. Two datasets of precipitation forecasts are evaluated, a set of two competing gridded precipitation forecasts from operational weather prediction models and sets of competing probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasts from model output statistics and from an ensemble of forecasts. For each test, data from each competing forecast are collected into one sample for each case day to avoid problems with spatial correlation. Next, several possible hypothesis test methods are evaluated: the paired t test, the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and two resampling tests. The more involved resampling test methodology is the most appropriate when testing threat scores from nonprobabilistic forecasts. ...}},

Over wide continental shelves, the semidiurnal tide is no longer a pure Kelvin wave but attains features of a zero-mode edge wave. As a result, the wave structure and the alongshore energy flux concentrate over the continental shelf and slope topography and become very sensitive to the variations of shelf geometry. When a semidiurnal Kelvin wave encounters alongshore changes of the shelf width, its energy scatters into other wave modes, including internal waves. A particularly strong scattering occurs on wide shelves, where Kelvin wave structure undergoes significant modifications over short alongshore distances. These dynamics are studied using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). This study found that when the alongshore energy flux in the Kelvin wave mode converges on the shelf, the offshore wave radiation occurs through barotropic waves, while for the divergent ...}},

Using the 1/12° OCCAM ocean model, we investigate the relationship between sea level at small, open-ocean islands and offshore sea level. For every such island or seamount in the model, we compare the shallow-water sea level with the steric and bottom pressure variability in a neighbouring ring of deep water. We find a latitude-dependent range of frequencies for which off-shore sea level is poorly correlated with island sea level. This poor coherence occurs in a spectral region for which steric signals dominate, but are unable to propagate as baroclinic Rossby waves. This mode of decoupling does not arise because of islands bathymetry, as the same decoupling is seen between deep ocean points and surrounding rings.}},

The estimate's dynamical consistency allows for the comprehensive attribution of steric changes in terms of advection, diffusion, and surface buoyancy exchange processes. Steric variations are found to be owing more to oceanic transports than to local surface buoyancy fluxes. Advection is responsible for steric variability in the tropical Indian and Pacific oceans. At extratropical latitudes, advection and diffusion appear to be equally important. Local surface buoyancy fluxes can contribute in some regions (e.g., the tropical Atlantic). Analysis of the anomalous wind stress curl shows that extra-equatorial vertical advection is driven primarily by Ekman pumping. The complexity of the interannual steric budget suggests that anomalous sea level is probably not predictable on the basis of ocean memory alone. Furthermore, proper parameterizations of mixing processes and good estimates of wind-driven transports both appear to be very important to reliable projections of interannual sea level.}},

The NCOM-4DVAR is formulated for weak-constraint data assimilation based on the in-direct representer method. In this study, satellite data consisting of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as well as in-situ data from Airborne eXpendable BathyThermographs (AXBTs), ARGO floats, and gliders is used to derive optimal corrections to the ocean model background and surface forcing provided by the atmospheric model. Three regional domains have been selected for this study: the first consists of the waters adjacent to Monterey Bay, California during the AOSN-II experiment; the second in a region surrounding Hawaii during the RIMPAC08 experiment; and a third region consisting of the Gulf of Mexico during the Grand Lagrangian Deployment (GLAD) surface drifter experiment. This Gulf of Mexico domain includes traditional observations as well as surface ocean velocity measurements derived from drifter position data. It is shown that the NCOM-4DVAR can correct the model solution via control of the initial conditions and model error terms and produce an improved forecast as a result. Also the NCOM-4DVAR can produce optimal corrections to the atmospheric forcing based on ocean data. These corrections alone can be applied to the specified surface forcing to produce an improved ocean forecast.}},

This difference is found to result mainly from a time shift in the development of the cold tongue between the two years. Easterlies were observed to be stronger in the western tropical Atlantic in April–May 2005 than in April–May 2006, and these winds favorably preconditioned oceanic subsurface conditions in the eastern Atlantic. However, it is also shown that a stronger than usual intraseasonal intensification of the southeastern trades was responsible for the rapid and early intense cooling of the sea surface temperatures in mid-May 2005 over a broad region extending from 20°W to the African coast and from 6°S to the equator. This particular event underscores the ability of local intraseasonal wind stress variability in the Gulf of Guinea to initiate the cold tongue seaso...}},

abstract = {{The relation between large-scale sea level variability and ocean circulation is studied using a numerical model. A global primitive equation model of the ocean is forced by daily winds and climatological heat fluxes corresponding to the period from January 1992 to January 1994. The physical nature of sea level's temporal variability from periods of days to a year is examined on the basis of spectral analyses of model results and comparisons with satellite altimetry and tide gauge measurements. The study elucidates and diagnoses the inhomogeneous physics of sea level change in space and frequency domain. At midlatitudes, large-scale sea level variability is primarily due to steric changes associated with the seasonal heating and cooling cycle of the surface layer. In comparison, changes in the tropics and high latitudes are mainly wind driven. Wind-driven variability exhibits a strong latitudinal dependence in itself. Wind-driven changes are largely baroclinic in the tropics but barotropic at higher latitudes. Baroclinic changes are dominated by the annual harmonic of the first baroclinic mode and is largest off the equator; variabilities associated with equatorial waves are smaller in comparison. Wind-driven barotropic changes exhibit a notable enhancement over several abyssal plains in the Southern Ocean, which is likely due to resonant planetary wave modes in basins semienclosed by discontinuities in potential vorticity. Otherwise, barotropic sea level changes are typically dominated by high frequencies with as much as half the total variance in periods shorter than 20 days, reflecting the frequency spectra of wind stress curl. Implications of the findings with regards to analyzing observations and data assimilation are discussed.}},

abstract = {{Current and new applications of 2D storm surge models such as the Dutch Continental Shelf Model (DCSM) require that the models provide proper estimates of the instantaneous water levels expressed relative to a particular geoid, rather than only the tide and surge components expressed relative to the ill-defined model's zero height surface. For DCSM, this is realized by adding the depth-averaged horizontal baroclinic pressure gradients to the model equations, which are derived from 4D salinity and temperature fields provided by the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory hydrodynamic model (POL's hindcast). The vertical datum of the extended model is fixed to that of the European Gravimetric Geoid model 2008 (EGG08). This is done by an adjustment of the model parameters that depend on the choice of the reference surface (e.g., bathymetry) and by referring the water levels along the open boundaries to this reference surface. Using different numerical experiments we investigate the effects on the water levels of several approximations we have made during the implementation. The ability of the model to reproduce both the mean sea level (MSL) and instantaneous water levels is assessed by a comparison with the MSL derived from POL's hindcast as well as with instantaneous water levels acquired by various radar altimeter satellites. From this comparison we conclude that our modeled MSL is in good agreement with the MSL derived from POL's hindcast; the standard deviation of the differences is below 2 cm. However, larger differences in MSL are observed when comparing the model output with the MSL derived from radar altimeter data. They are attributed to either geoid errors or errors in the used salinity and temperature fields. The root mean squared (rms) differences between observed and modeled instantaneous water levels over the entire model domain varies from 9 cm for data acquired by the TOPEX satellite to 11 cm for data acquired by the GFO-1 satellite. These numbers improve to 8–10 cm on the North Sea, for data acquired by the TOPEX and ERS-2 satellites, respectively. These numbers are a factor two to three larger than the expected accuracy of water levels derived from radar altimeter data (which is ∼ 4 cm ). About 25\% of these differences can be explained by a bias between the modeled and observed water levels of a single satellite pass. These biases are attributed to errors in the applied correction for the net steric expansion/contraction of the global oceans as this is not captured by DCSM that makes use of the Boussinesq approximation, as well as other errors in model and data.}},

Although the form of this diagram is general, it is especially useful in evaluating complex models, such as those used to study geophysical phenomena. Examples are given showing that the diagram can be used to summarize the relative merits of a collection of different models or to track changes in performance of a model as it is modified. Methods are suggested for indicating on these diagrams the statistical significance of apparent differences, and the degree to which observational uncertainty and unforced internal variability limit the expected agreement between model-simulated and observed behaviors. The geometric relationship between the statistics plotted on the diagram also provides some guidance for devising skill scores that appropriately weight among the various measures of pattern correspondence.}},

abstract = {{The National Ocean Service (NOS), Center for Operational Products and Services installed a Physical Oceanographic Real Time System (PORTS) in San Francisco Bay during 1998 to provide water surface elevation, currents at PORTS prediction depth as well as near-surface temperature and salinity. To complement the PORTS, a new nowcast/forecast system (consistent with NOS procedures) has been constructed. This new nowcast/forecast system is based on the Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) using a computational domain, which extends from Rio Vista on the Sacramento River and Antioch on the San Joaquin River through Suisun and San Pablo Bays and Upper and Lower San Francisco Bay out onto the continental shelf. This paper presents the FVCOM setup, testing, and validation for tidal and hindcast scenarios. In addition, the San Francisco Bay Operational Forecast System (SFBOFS) setup within the NOS Coastal Ocean Model Framework (COMF) is discussed. The SFBOFS performance during a semi-operational nowcast/forecast test period is presented and the production webpage is also briefly introduced. FVCOM, the core of SFBOFS, has been found to run robustly during the test period. Amplitudes and epochs of the M2 S2, N2, K2, K1, O1, P1, and Q1 constituents from the model tide-only simulation scenario are very close to the observed values at all stations. NOS skill assessment and RMS errors of all variables indicate that most statistical parameters pass the assessment criteria, and the model predictions are in agreement with measurements for both hindcast and semi-operational nowcast/forecast scenarios.}},

It also highlights certain areas of cutting-edge research. Stephen Griffies presents material that spans a broad spectrum of issues critical for modern ocean climate models. Topics are organized into parts consisting of related chapters, with each part largely self-contained. Early chapters focus on the basic equations arising from classical mechanics and thermodynamics used to rationalize ocean fluid dynamics. These equations are then cast into a form appropriate for numerical models of finite grid resolution. Basic discretization methods are described for commonly used classes of ocean climate models. The book proceeds to focus on the parameterization of phenomena occurring at scales unresolved by the ocean model, which represents a large part of modern oceanographic research. The final part provides a tutorial on the tensor methods that are used throughout the book, in a general and elegant fashion, to formulate the equations.}},

To resolve special features of the ocean circulation, such as the Equatorial Undercurrent, the numerical model allows for a variable spacing in either the zonal or meridional direction. The model is designed to be as consistent as possible with the continuous equations with respect to energy. It is demonstrated that no fictitious energy generation or decay is associated with the nonlinear terms in the finite difference form of the momentum equations. The energy generation by buoyancy forces for the numerical model is also designed in such a way that no energy “leak” occurs in the transformation from potential to kinetic energy.}},

However, in many coastal areas around the world, especially in underdeveloped countries, little if any sea level forecasting is available, despite the often acute need. Here a simple linear-regression model based on modest wind forecast capability and records of local coastal sea level, wind, and pressure is developed and tested. Despite its simplicity, the model is based on robust ocean dynamics, in particular coastal Ekman circulation principles. The empirical model is tested using sea level observations at Atlantic City, New Jersey. The performance of the model is comparable to that of ESSM. For the 2-yr time period 1997–98, ESSM explains 79\% of the total observed subtidal frequency sea level while the model presented here explains 74\%.

abstract = {{Abstract We study below with the aid of linearized equations, but using a quadratic bottom friction law, the barotropic forced (aperiodic) response to wind stress or external pressure gradient of various simple continental shelf models. The frictionless response to longshore wind stress shows many of the characteristics of the classical ?coastal jet? problem but is complicated by depth variations, mainly because of the generation of vorticity over a sloping bottom. Positive vorticity is generated where the depth increases to the left of the wind (in the Northern Hemisphere) and negative vorticity where the depth gradient is opposite. Thus, in a deep gulf separated from the open ocean by a shallow bank (in the Gulf of Maine, for example), a double-gyre circulation tends to be established. Friction places a definite limit on the maximum velocities which are produced by a storm of given intensity, the limit being more or less independent of depth. For typical shelf conditions the time of establishment of frictionally controlled flow is a few times 104 seconds, longer where the establishment of geostrophic balance requires larger influx of water into the shore zone (e.g., in a wide gulf). Outside the shelf break, frictionally controlled flow is never established by any storm of realistic duration. The response remains essentially of the frictionless transient type with a progressive development of a coastal jet that intensifies with time. A realistic, combined model may be obtained by patching a coastal jet over the open ocean to frictionally controlled flow over the shelf. This reveals the further slow change in surface level over the shelf, which, however, does not significantly influence the frictionally controlled flow pattern. A comparison of the theoretical results with observations in the Gulf of Maine suggests that the observed double-gyre circulation (known to be most intense in May) is a barotropic response to northeasterly wind stress. It is hypothesized that these winds dominate the air-sea momentum exchange early in the season because air blowing off the continent is much warmer than the sea surface and produces only low stresses.}},

For the raw storm surge forecasts, the SIT-NYHOPS model has the lowest root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) on average, while the NOAA-ET has the largest RMSEs after hour 24 as a result of a relatively large negative surge bias. The SIT-NYHOPS and SBSS also have a slight negative surge bias after hour 24. Many of the underpredicted surges in the SBSS ensemble are associated with large waves at an offshore buoy, thus illustrating the potential importance of nearshore wave breaking (radiation stresses) on the surge predictions.

abstract = {{Ensemble simulation propagates a collection of initial states forward in time in a Monte Carlo fashion. Depending on the fidelity of the model and the properties of the initial ensemble, the goal of ensemble simulation can range from merely quantifying variations in the sensitivity of the model all the way to providing actionable probability forecasts of the future. Whatever the goal is, success depends on the properties of the ensemble, and there is a longstanding discussion in meteorology as to the size of initial condition ensemble most appropriate for Numerical Weather Prediction. In terms of resource allocation: how is one to divide finite computing resources between model complexity, ensemble size, data assimilation and other components of the forecast system. One wishes to avoid undersampling information available from the model's dynamics, yet one also wishes to use the highest fidelity model available. Arguably, a higher fidelity model can better exploit a larger ensemble; nevertheless it is often suggested that a relatively small ensemble, say \textbackslashtextasciitilde16 members, is sufficient and that larger ensembles are not an effective investment of resources. This claim is shown to be dubious when the goal is probabilistic forecasting, even in settings where the forecast model is informative but imperfect. Probability forecasts for a ?simple? physical system are evaluated at different lead times; ensembles of up to 256 members are considered. The pure density estimation context (where ensemble members are drawn from the same underlying distribution as the target) differs from the forecasting context, where one is given a high fidelity (but imperfect) model. In the forecasting context, the information provided by additional members depends also on the fidelity of the model, the ensemble formation scheme (data assimilation), the ensemble interpretation and the nature of the observational noise. The effect of increasing the ensemble size is quantified by its relative information content (in bits) using a proper skill score. Doubling the ensemble size is demonstrated to yield a non-trivial increase in the information content (forecast skill) for an ensemble with well over 16 members; this result stands in forecasting a mathematical system and a physical system. Indeed, even at the largest ensemble sizes considered (128 and 256), there are lead times where the forecast information is still increasing with ensemble size. Ultimately, model error will limit the value of ever larger ensembles. No support is found, however, for limiting design studies to the sizes commonly found in seasonal and climate studies. It is suggested that ensemble size be considered more explicitly in future design studies of forecast systems on all time scales.}},

title = {{Developing Better Predictions for Extreme Water Levels: Final Data Report.}}, 
abstract = {{The major hazard in coastal regions is inundation through extreme water levels generated in the ocean through different mechanisms such as storm surges and tsunamis or through a combination of effects such as a relatively small storm surge coinciding with high astronomical tides. With rising in sea level, given water levels will be exceeded more and more frequently as progressively less severe storm conditions are required to achieve that water level.
Therefore, it is critical that the exceedance probabilities of extreme water levels are accurately evaluated to inform flood and erosion risk-based management and for future planning. To address this concern, this study estimated present day extreme sea level exceedance probabilities due to storm surges, tides and mean sea level around the whole coastline of Australia through the application of a numerical model.
The SCHISM hydrodynamic model, forced by TPXO tides and JRA55 atmospheric reanalysis (wind and air pressure), was successfully applied to produce a 59 year sealevel hindcast (1958- 2016) for the entire Australian region. The outputs provide uninterrupted hourly sea level records at <1 km resolution around the Australian coast. Improvements compared to the previous Haigh et al. [1] dataset included: extending the hindcast by six years including several record storm surge events, higher spatial resolution, improved meteorological forcing, and 3-D hydrodynamic model implementation. Other physical processes, missing from earlier studies, were also examined in detail including: effects of surface gravity waves, continental shelf waves, and meteorological tsunamis.
Extreme value analysis has been applied to the sea level data to predict Average Recurrence Intervals (ARI) at \textbackslashtextasciitilde1km spacing around the entire Australian coastline including islands. These statistics and relevant plots and time series data have been made available to the public via an interactive web tool, providing a consistent, accessible, up-to-date dataset for use by coastal planners and emergency managers.}},

The system is completely automated and operates unattended at pre-scheduled intervals as well as in event-triggered mode in response to Atlantic-basin tropical cyclone advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center. The system provides up to 72-h forecasts forward depending on the input dataset duration. Spatially, the system spans the entire Florida coastline by employing four high-resolution domains with resolutions as fine as 10–30 m in the near-shore and overland to allow the system to resolve fine estuarine details such as in the Intracoastal Waterway and minor tributaries. The system has been validated in both hindcast and nowcast/forecast modes using water level and salinity data from a variety of sources and has been found to run robustly during the test periods.

author = {Moore, Stuart Alex}, 
abstract = {{The large-scale wind-driven ocean circulation is found to be sensitive to the choice of both the lateral boundary condition and the method of implementation. Where model boundaries consist of irregular piecewise-constant steps, a classical free-slip like circulation is only maintained when the free-slip condition is implemented using the Vorticity-Divergence form of the viscous stress tensor. The Ghost-Point method is only capable of such a solution when the boundary located relative vorticity is explicitly set to zero. Free-slip solutions in particular, regardless of the method of implementation, are highly sensitive to the orientation of the piecewise-constant steps and we suggest two mechanisms, one physical and one numerical, by which this sensitivity can be understood.In the second part of this thesis, the spurious stress irregular piecewise-constant coastlines exert on the model flow is quantified by numerically modelling impulsive boundary layer development. In the absence of planetary rotation, the Vorticity-Divergence method of implementation is found to be superior to the Ghost-Point method for flows along irregular coastlines, but is shown to be a dangerous choice as the method of implementation when planetary rotation is included. Including planetary rotation induces the formation of jets near the domain boundaries which alter both the across-channel flow profile and the time dependence of the boundary shear stress from 1/t1/2, for non-rotating cases, to 1/t1/4, for rotating cases. We have developed a simple theoretical model of boundary layer development under the influence of rotation that explains these results.Finally, the phenomenon of western boundary current separation is studied and found to be a consistent feature of both the Ghost-Point and Vorticity-Divergence implemented no-slip model solutions. Separation is completely suppressed under Vorticity-Divergence implemented free-slip conditions. Separation is observed under Ghost-Point implemented free-slip conditions, but can be suppressed by explicitly setting the boundary located relative vorticity to zero.}}

The error budget evaluates the individual contribution of errors in each of the altimetric range corrections, orbit errors caused by errors in the background ocean tide potential, and errors caused by the general circulation of the oceans, to errors in the ocean tide models of the eight principal diurnal and semidiurnal tidal components, and the two principal long‐period tidal components. The effect of continually updating the T/P empirical ocean tide models during the primary T/P mission is illustrated through tide gauge comparisons and then used to predict the impact of further updates during the extended mission. Both the tide gauge comparisons and the error analysis predict errors in the tide models for the eight principal diurnal and semidiurnal constituents to be of the order of 2–3 cm root‐sum‐square. The dominant source of errors in the T/P ocean tide models appears to be caused by the general circulation of the oceans observed by the T/P altimeter. Further updates of the T/P empirical ocean tide models during the extended mission should not provide significant improvements in the diurnal and semidiurnal ocean tide models but should provide significant improvements in the long‐period ocean tide models, particularly in the monthly (Mm) tidal component.}},

Recent efforts in satellite altimetry and numerical modeling have improved accuracy over near-shore areas. In this study we used data from tide gauges (TGs), SAR-mode altimetry from two satellites [Sentinel-3A (S3) and CryoSat-2 (C2)], and a state-of-the-art high-resolution regional coupled environmental prediction model (Amm15) to undertake an inter-comparison between the observations and the model. The aim is to quantify our capability to measure TWL around the United Kingdom coast, and to quantify the capacity of the model to represent coastal TWL. Results show good agreement between the satellite and TG data [the mean correlation (R) over seventeen TGs between June 2016 and September 2017 is 0.85 for S3 and 0.80 for C2]. The satellite-model comparison shows that the variability is well captured (R = 0.98 for both satellite), however, there is an offset (−0.23 m for S3, −0.15 m for C2) between the satellite and model data, that is near-constant across the domain. This offset is partly attributed to the difference in the reference level used by the satellites and the model, and residual differences linked to the temporal resolution of the model. The best agreement between model and satellite is seen away from the coast, further than 3–4 km offshore. However, even within the coastal band, R remains high, ∼0.95 (S3) and ∼0.96 (C2). In conclusion, models are still essential to represent TWL in coastal regions where there is no cover from in-situ observations, but satellite altimeters can now provide valuable observations that are reliable much closer to the coast than before.}},

Cross-shelf circulation over the inner shelf has ecological and geophysical consequences: It connects the shore to the open ocean by transporting pollutants, larvae, phytoplankton, nutrients, and sediment. This review of circulation and momentum balances over the inner continental shelf contrasts prior studies, which focused mainly on the roles of along-shelf wind and pressure gradients, with recent understanding of the dominant roles of cross-shelf wind and surface gravity waves.}},

Recent literature shows that changes in tidal amplitude have been ubiquitous worldwide over the past century, often in response to wetland reclamation, channel dredging, and other environmental changes. While tidal amplitude changes are sometimes slight (<1\%) or even negative, we identify two types of systems that are particularly prone to tidal amplification: (a) shallow, strongly damped systems, in which a small increase in depth produces a large decrease in effective friction, and (b) systems in which wave reflection and resonance are strongly influenced by changes to depth, friction, and convergence. The largest changes in amplitude occur inland, some distance from the coast, and can sometimes be measured in meters. Tide changes are a leading indicator that the dynamics of storm surges and river flood waves have also changed and are often associated with shifts in sediment transport, salinity intrusion, and ecosystem properties. Therefore, the dynamics of tidal evolution have major implications for coastal management, particularly for systems that are sensitive to changes in geometry induced by sea-level rise and anthropogenic development.}},

abstract = {{Abstract An improved version of the global hydrodynamic tide solutions [finite element solutions (FESs) FES94, FES95.2.1, and FES98] has been developed, implemented, and validated. The new model is based on the resolution of the tidal barotropic equations on a global finite element grid without any open boundary condition, which leads to solutions independent of in situ data (no open boundary conditions and no assimilation). The accuracy of these “free” solutions is improved by assimilating tide gauge and TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) altimeter information through a representer assimilation method. This leads to the FES99 version of this model. For the eight main constituents of the tidal spectrum (M2, S2, N2, K2, 2N2, K1, O1, and Q1), about 700 tide gauges and 687 T/P altimetric measurements are assimilated. An original algorithm is developed to calculate the tidal harmonic constituents at crossover points of the T/P altimeter database. Additional work is performed for the S2 wave by reconsidering the inverse bar...}},

These differences of opinion are fueled by a lack of clarity and/or understanding concerning the nature of goodness in weather forecasting. This lack of clarity and understanding complicates the processes of formulating and evaluating weather forecasts and undermines their ultimate usefulness. Three distinct types of goodness are identified in this paper: 1) the correspondence between forecasters? judgments and their forecasts (type 1 goodness, or consistency), 2) the correspondence between the forecasts and the matching observations (type 2 goodness, or quality), and 3) the incremental economic and/or other benefits realized by decision makers through the use of the forecasts (type 3 goodness, or value). Each type of goodness is defined and described in some detail. In addition, issues related to the measurement of consistency, quality, and value are discussed. Relationships among the three types of goodness are also considered. It is shown by example that the level of consistency directly impacts the levels of both quality and value. Moreover, recent studies of quality/value relationships have revealed that these relationships are inherently nonlinear and may not be monotonic unless the multifaceted nature of quality is respected. Some implications of these considerations for various practices related to operational forecasting are discussed. Changes in these practices that could enhance the goodness of weather forecasts in one or more respects are identified.}},

author = {Palmer, T N}, 
journal = {Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society}, 
doi = {10.1002/qj.1923}, 
abstract = {{There is no more challenging problem in computational science than that of estimating, as accurately as science and technology allows, the future evolution of Earth's climate; nor indeed is there a problem whose solution has such importance and urgency. Historically, the simulation tools needed to predict climate have been developed, somewhat independently, at a number of weather and climate institutes around the world. While these simulators are individually deterministic, it is often assumed that the resulting diversity provides a useful quantification of uncertainty in global or regional predictions. However, this notion is not well founded theoretically and corresponding ‘multi-simulator’ estimates of uncertainty can be prone to systemic failure. Separate to this, individual institutes are now facing considerable challenges in finding the human and computational resources needed to develop more accurate weather and climate simulators with higher resolution and full Earth-system complexity. A new approach, originally designed to improve reliability in ensemble-based numerical weather prediction, is introduced to help solve these two rather different problems. Using stochastic mathematics, this approach recognizes uncertainty explicitly in the parametrized representation of unresolved climatic processes. Stochastic parametrization is shown to be more consistent with the underlying equations of motion and, moreover, provides more skilful estimates of uncertainty when compared with estimates from traditional multi-simulator ensembles, on time-scales where verification data exist. Stochastic parametrization can also help reduce long-term biases which have bedevilled numerical simulations of climate from the earliest days to the present. As a result, it is suggested that the need to maintain a large ‘gene pool’ of quasi-independent deterministic simulators may be obviated by the development of probabilistic Earth-system simulators. Consistent with the conclusions of the World Summit on Climate Modelling, this in turn implies that individual institutes will be able to pool human and computational resources in developing future-generation simulators, thus benefitting from economies of scale; the establishment of the Airbus consortium provides a useful analogy here. As a further stimulus for such evolution, discussion is given to a potential new synergy between the development of dynamical cores, and stochastic processing hardware. However, it is concluded that the traditional challenge in numerical weather prediction, of reducing deterministic measures of forecast error, may increasingly become an obstacle to the seamless development of probabilistic weather and climate simulators, paradoxical as that may appear at first sight. Indeed, going further, it is argued that it may be time to consider focusing operational weather forecast development entirely on high-resolution ensemble prediction systems. Finally, by considering the exceptionally challenging problem of quantifying cloud feedback in climate change, it is argued that the development of the probabilistic Earth-system simulator may actually provide a route to reducing uncertainty in climate prediction.

Using 144 yr (1854–1997) of extended reconstructed SLP data, seasonal patterns of its variability are reinvestigated in detail. New features on fundamental structure of its annual and semiannual cycles are revealed in two aspects. First, the spatiotemporal patterns of yearly and half-yearly SLPs are basically determined by a network of “amphidromes,” which are surrounded by rotational variations. Fourteen cyclonic and anticyclonic annual SLP amphidromes (half each and often in pair) are found in the global ocean, while the numbers of the two types of semiannual amphidrome are 11 and 9, respectively. The second dominant feature in SLP variability is the pattern of oscillation or seesaw for both annual and semiannual components. At least eight oscillation zones are identified for the annual cycle, which can be categorized into a boreal winter mode and an austral winter mode. As for the semiannual cycle, the seesaw pattern is geographically divided into three regimes: the North Pacific regime, the North Atlantic regime, and the Southern Ocean regime. These findings serve as a new contribution to characterizing and understanding the seasonality of the global ocean–atmosphere system.}},

These interbasin amplitude and phase variations are robust features that are reproduced by numerical solutions of the shallow-water equations, even for a constant-depth ocean with schematic interconnected rectangular basins. A simplified analytical model for cooscillating connected basins also reproduces the principal features observed in the empirical solutions. This simple model is largely kinematic. Zonally averaged elevations within a simple closed basin would be nearly in equilibrium with the gravitational potential, except for a constant offset required to conserve mass. With connected basins these offsets are mostly eliminated by interbasin mass flux. Because of rotation, this flux occurs mostly in a narrow bou...}},

Particular attention is paid to the role of stratification which in moderate amounts can eliminate backscattered free-waves which occur. theoretically, in a barotropic ocean. Numerical simulations using widening and narrowing shelf topographies show that the strength of the forward scattering into transmitted CTW modes is proportional to a topographic warp factor which estimates the severity of the topographic irregularities. The forward-scattering is further amplified by density stratification. Within the scattering region itself, the strengths of the scattered-wave-induced currents exhibit substantial variation over short spatial scales. There is generally a marked intensification of the flow within the scattering region, and rapid variations in phase. On narrowing shelves...}},

This paper provides an accuracy assessment of 10 such tide models and discusses their benefits in many fields including geodesy, oceanography, and geophysics. A variety of tests indicate that all these tide models agree within 2\&\#8211;3 cm in the deep ocean, and they represent a significant improvement over the classical Schwiderski 1980 model by approximately 5 cm rms. As a result, two tide models were selected for the reprocessing of TOPEX/POSEIDON Geophysical Data Records in late 1995. Current ocean tide models allow an improved observation of deep ocean surface dynamic topography using satellite altimetry. Other significant contributions include their applications in an improved orbit computation for TOPEX/POSEIDON and other geodetic satellites, to yield accurate predictions of Earth rotation excitations and improved estimates of ocean loading corrections for geodetic observatories, and to allow better separation of astronomical tides from phenomena with meteorological and geophysical origins. The largest differences between these tide models occur in shallow waters, indicating that the current models are still problematic in these areas. Future improvement of global tide models is anticipated with additional high-quality altimeter data and with advances in numerical techniques to assimilate data into high-resolution hydrodynamic models.}},

Reference frame differences and signal due to present-day mass trends cannot reconcile these differences. We examine sensitivity to the GIA Earth model by fitting to a subset of the GPS velocities and find substantial regional sensitivity, but no single Earth model is able to reduce the disagreement in all regions. We suggest errors in ice history and neglected lateral Earth structure dominate model-data differences, and urge caution in the use of modeled GIA uplift alone when interpreting regional- and global- scale absolute (geocentric) sea level from tide gauge data.}},

Implemented with the Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) as its core three-dimensional oceanographic circulation model, NGOFS produces a real-time nowcast (−6 h to zero) and six-hourly, two-day forecast guidance for water levels and three-dimensional currents, water temperature and salinity over the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf. Designed as a regional scale prediction system, NGOFS lacks sufficient spatial coverage and/or resolution to fully resolve hydrodynamic features in critical seaports and estuaries. To overcome this shortcoming and better support the needs of marine navigation, emergency response, and environmental management, two FVCOM-based, high-resolution, estuary-scale nested forecast modeling systems, namely the Northwest and Northeast Gulf of Mexico Operational Forecast Systems (NWGOFS and NEGOFS), have been developed through one-way nesting in NGOFS. Using the atmospheric forecast guidance from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)/NWS (National Weather Services)’ North American Mesoscale (NAM) Forecast System, US Geological Survey (USGS) river discharge observations, and the NGOFS water level, current, water temperature and salinity as the surface, river, and open ocean boundary forcing, respectively, a six-month model hindcast for the period October 2010–March 2011 has been conducted. Modeled water levels, currents, salinity and water temperature are compared with observations using the NOS standard skill assessment software. Skill assessment scores indicated that NWGOFS and NEGOFS demonstrate improvement over NGOFS. The NWGOFS and NEGOFS are under real-time nowcast/forecast test and evaluation by NOS’s Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS). The forecast systems are scheduled to be implemented operational on NOAA Weather \&amp; Climate Operational Supercomputing System (WCOSS) in June 2014.}},

The length scale of the variability is 100–150 km, with a westward phase speed of 15–19 cm s−1 and dominant periods between 40 and 80 days. A continuously stratified quasigeostrophic model is solved to analyze the baroclinic stability of the climatological SEC. Large growth rate of the instability waves (with e-folding timescale of less than 50 days) can be found east of the active region of intraseasonal variability during the July–September season, when the SEC and the Pacific to Indian Ocean throughflow are at their strongest. Geostrophic current shear in the upper 200-m ocean is crucial for the growth of the instability. The results suggest that the baroclinic instability draws most of its energy from the available potential energy associated with the throughflow, and, to a lesser degree, by local Ekman pump...}},

The currents evolve from zero at blocked ends of the shelf and basin. Such evolution is essentially barotropic (even for baroclinic forcing) and is relevant to all flow adjustments after longshore changes of depth profile or forcing. The distance over which this evolution takes place is investigated analytically for simple geometries, and numerically for a range of shelf, slope and ocean widths, shelf/ocean depth ratios, frictional decay rates and oscillatory frequencies. A close correspondence is found with the decay distance (group velocity x decay time) for a lowest mode continental shelf wave, often exceeding 1000 km. This correspondence is used to interpret some published model calculations of shelf and slope currents or return flows resulting from wind-stress or alongshore pressure gradients. Where a slope current is evolving, coastal sea levels do not follow oceanic levels. Implications for coastal/oceanic level differences are discussed. Oceanic sea-level features of shorter scale than the above 1000 km (say) do not penetrate fully to the coast. However, coastal sea levels averaged around small islands without broad shelves well represent surrounding oceanic levels.}},

The review takes the form of a ‘snapshot’ of models, related observing systems and dissemination procedures in use early in 1999. A brief account of surge, tide and wave dynamics and factors influencing them combined with regional factors such as water depth, shallow water extent, exposure (fetch), etc., provides a basis for understanding the diversity in design and implementation of the different national systems. It is shown that the systems in the different coastal states have evolved to address the needs of their own coastal and marine environments; take account of relevant processes and dynamics; and employ technologies such as data assimilation where appropriate. As a result, there are areas of common interest and overlap. Possibilities for rationalising systems or enhancing benefits by sharing of forecast products and data are discussed. Improved communication among operational agencies, perhaps using the PROMISE web pages (http://www.pol.ac.uk/promise/) to facilitate exchange of information on systems, operational developments and experience, is suggested as a means of encouraging collaboration and dissemination of new techniques.}},

Removal of the OM and IB from the tide-gauge record produces residual time series with a mean global variance reduction of 53\%. The OM is mis-scaled for certain regions, and 68\% of the residual time series contain a significant seasonal variability after removal of the OM and IB from the tide-gauge data. Including OM admittance parameters and seasonal coefficients in a regression model for each station, with IB also removed, produces residual time series with mean global variance reduction of 71\%. Examination of the regional improvement in variance caused by scaling the OM, including seasonal terms, or both, indicates weakness in the model at predicting sea-level variation for constricted ocean regions. The model is particularly effective at reproducing sea-level variation for stations in North America, Europe, and Japan. The RMS residual for many stations in these areas is 25–35 mm. The production of “cleaner” tide-gauge time series, with oceanographic variability removed, is important for future analysis of nonsecular and regionally differing sea-level variations. Understanding the ocean model's strengths and weaknesses will allow for future improvements of the model.}},

This study presents a low-cost method for mapping shoreline change that harnesses smartphone images collected by the community and uploaded to social media platforms. A smartphone camera cradle installed overlooking a coastal region is used to constrain the crowd-sourced camera extrinsic parameters and accompanying signage instructs participants on how to share their image to social media using a site-specific hashtag identifier. Surveyed ground control points solve for the focal length of the smartphone lens and more-accurately resolve the camera extrinsic parameters. Shoreline position is subsequently mapped on georectified images using an edge detection technique based on the red and blue colour channels. A validation of the method was conducted at two sandy beaches in SE Australia and resulted in strong community participation (400 images submitted over 7 months by 198 individual contributors). Concurrent shoreline surveys using RTK-GNSS indicated that shoreline accuracy using this crowd-sourced approach is comparable to that of established coastal imaging systems, with cross-shore shoreline accuracy best for these two elevated validation sites (camera elevation = 17.3 m–27.1 m above MSL) in the camera nearfield (RMSD ≈ 1.4 m) and RMSD ranging between 2.6 and 3.9 m over coastal stretches spanning up to 1 km. Minimal differences in shoreline accuracy were observed between low resolution images characteristic of those uploaded to social media and higher resolution images sourced from the smartphone. The successful application of this low-cost approach, combined with the proliferation of smartphones and social media usage, open up new possibilities for crowd-sourced shoreline change mapping at suitable coastal locations worldwide.}},

First-order characteristics of the observed spectra, including amplitude and spectral moments, vary slowly geographically. The spectrum model is horizontally anisotropic, accommodating observations that zonal wavenumber–frequency spectra are dominated by a “nondispersive line.” Qualitative and quantitative agreement is found with one-dimensional frequency and wavenumber spectra and observed vertical profiles of variance.

abstract = {{Abstract An ocean flow that has all its scales resolved on a model grid can be more efficiently calculated to within a required accuracy by using high-order numerics than by grid refinement with low-order numerics. The differencing order must be at least as great as the space–time dimensionality D of the model to ensure that grid refinement reduces truncation error at least as quickly as computational cost increases. Ocean flows often have variability on a wide range of scales that cannot all be resolved on any practical grid. In such circumstances the distribution of variability among the scales determines whether grid refinement or increased order results in the greatest accuracy per unit computational cost. A model that simulates the −5/3 power law of the inertial subrange of three-dimensional turbulence would most efficiently exploit low-order numerics for all terms. The spectra of different terms in the equations of motion can be different and can therefore require different orders of accuracy for ef...}},

The enhancement extends O(1) km above the topography, suggesting that mixing is supported by the breaking of gravity waves radiated from the ocean bottom. In this study, it is shown that the observed mixing rates can be sustained by internal waves generated by geostrophic motions flowing over bottom topography. Weakly nonlinear theory is used to describe the internal wave generation and the feedback of the waves on the zonally averaged flow. Vigorous inertial oscillations are driven at the ocean bottom by waves generated at steep topography. The wave radiation and dissipation at equilibrium is therefore the result of both geostrophic flow and inertial oscillations differing substantially from the classical lee-wave problem. The theoretical predictions are tested versus two-dimensional high-resolution numerical simulations with parameters representative of ...}},

Internal tides are simply a form of internal wave with quasi-tidal periodicity, though north of their inertial latitudes they should be trapped to bottom topographic features, including continental shelves. In oceans of constant depth, their theory is reducible to that of ordinary (surface) tides in very shallow equivalent oceans. The short wavelengths appropriate to internal tides, however, mean that localized nonglobal solutions are most useful. Theory and observation both support the notion that internal tides are generated by the passage of the surface tide over topographic features, though it is not yet possible to say with certainty that any of several mechanisms dominates. A tabulation of worldwide observations suggests that internal semidiurnal tides contain 10–50\% of the energy of the surface tide. Consideration of both the rate of input of energy into the internal tides and the rate of loss from them leads to the conclusion that the internal tides are probably not a significant sink for energy extracted from the surface tide. The energy does appear significant compared with the rates of input of energy to the general circulation by wind and thermal forcing. Unlike other internal waves the tides are dominated by the lowest vertical modes.}},

The performances of the numerical schemes are tested in prognostic integrations of an ocean model to demonstrate numerical accuracy and long-term integral stability. Two typical geometries, an isolated tall seamount and an unforced basin with sloping boundaries, are considered for the special case of no external forcing and horizontal isopycnals to test numerical accuracy.

abstract = {{Every beginning student of geophysical fluid dynamics knows that steady--state wind-driven currents are directed to the right of the wind in the northern hemisphere. In contrast, the fact that wind-induced currents may under some specific conditions be of the opposite direction is mentioned in only a few papers. Here, a succession of simple explicit solutions is used to illustrate that the wind varying at subinertial frequencies always generates currents directed to its right, whereas at superinertial frequencies the wind rotating clockwise (counterclockwise) coincides with currents directed to its left (right). The difference is related to a dynamics differing in the two frequency bands. At subinertial frequencies, friction is primarily balanced by the Coriolis acceleration, and therefore the currents vary in phase with the wind while being directed to its right. At superinertial frequencies, the primary balance is between friction and local acceleration, implying that the currents lag behind the wind that causes them while pointing down the forcing. The former dynamic regime was originally considered by Vagn Walfrid Ekman (in 1905), the latter by Karl Jakob Zöppritz (in 1878). The destiny of the two contributions, however, was completely different: Ekman's is widely appreciated today, whereas Zöppritz's is rarely mentioned. Although Zöppritz's findings were adversely influenced by his consideration of the laminar rather than turbulent viscosity, his neglect of the Coriolis acceleration was acceptable and his solution therefore formally correct at superinertial frequencies.

Here we review comprehensively these important changes in tidal properties, many of which remain poorly understood. Over long geological time scales, tectonic processes drive variations in basin size, depth, and shape and hence the resonant properties of ocean basins. On shorter geological time scales, changes in oceanic tidal properties are dominated by variations in water depth. A growing number of studies have identified widespread, sometimes regionally coherent, positive, and negative trends in tidal constituents and levels during the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries. Determining the causes is challenging because a tide measured at a coastal gauge integrates the effects of local, regional, and oceanic changes. Here, we highlight six main factors that can cause changes in measured tidal statistics on local scales and a further eight possible regional/global driving mechanisms. Since only a few studies have combined observations and models, or modeled at a temporal/spatial resolution capable of resolving both ultralocal and large‐scale global changes, the individual contributions from local and regional mechanisms remain uncertain. Nonetheless, modeling studies project that sea level rise and climate change will continue to alter tides over the next several centuries, with regionally coherent modes of change caused by alterations to coastal morphology and ice sheet extent. Hence, a better understanding of the causes and consequences of tidal variations is needed to help assess the implications for coastal defense, risk assessment, and ecological change. Tides are one of the most persistent and dominant forces that shape our planet. The regular and predictable daily, fortnightly, monthly, annual, interannual, and longer‐term changes in tides, driven by astronomical forces, are well understood. However, scientists and engineers have observed for some time that tides at many locations are shifting considerably due to nonastronomical factors. Here, we carry out a review of these important changes in tides, many of which remain poorly understood. We highlight that over long geological time scales, changes in tides are driven by tectonic processes, which alter the size, depth, and shape of the ocean. Over shorter geological time scales, changes in tides are mainly driven by changes in water depth. In recent decades, a growing number of studies have identified widespread, and sometimes regionally coherent, changes in tides during the last 150 years. However, determining exactly what has caused these more recent changes in tides has proven difficult. We discuss the local and regional/global mechanisms that might be responsible for the observed changes. Modeling studies predict that sea level rise and climate change will continue to alter tides over the next several centuries. Therefore, a better understanding of what is causing changes in tides is needed. Tidal properties have changed, and continue to evolve, due to nonastronomical factors Attributing causation remains challenging Regionally coherent increases/decreases in tidal properties are likely to occur over the next centuries}},

The scheme is computationally efficient and is capable of simulating the three major mechanisms of vertical turbulent mixing in the upper ocean, that is, wind stirring, shear instability, and convective overturning. The hybrid scheme is first tested in a one-dimensional model against the Kraus–Turner-type bulk mixed layer model and the Mellor–Yamada level 2.5 (MY2.5) turbulence closure model. As compared with those two models, the hybrid model behaves more reasonably in both idealized experiments and realistic simulations. The improved behavior of the hybrid model can be attributed to its more complete physics. For example, the MY2.5 model underpredicts mixed layer depth at high latitudes due to its lack of wind stirring and penetrative convection, while the Kraus–Turn...}},

This study focuses on an analysis of long-term sea level records located in the Atlantic and Pacific, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. It shows that changes of tidal amplitude and/or phase have taken place over large scales. The principal solar semidiurnal (S2) tide shows the largest trends. At some locations, the change in the mean tidal range due to tidal trends is significant compared with the trend in mean sea level. Thus, it might be advisable to consider these changes in studies of the impact of rising sea level. Numerical simulations of the principal lunar semidiurnal tide (M2) demonstrate a model sensitivity in the North Atlantic to changes in glacial isostatic adjustment and sea level rise, which captures 30–40\% of the magnitude of the trends in observations. However, the spatial patterns do not agree well with those inferred from observations, suggesting that forward global models are currently useful for qualitative but not quantitative understanding of the observed trends. A global free oscillation synthesis indicates that sea level rise due to glacial isostatic adjustment leads to decreasing global resonant periods and increasing damping in the system and a coupled oscillator model shows that changes in sea level on the shelf are much more effective at perturbing shelf and ocean tides than sea level changes in the deep ocean.}},

Measurements were made at depths of 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 m using S4 current meters, at depths down to about 200 m using profiling current meters, and at depths deeper than 200 m using Aanderaa current meters. Anemometers were deployed at two locations along the inlet. A laterally integrated, two-dimensional numerical model of the inlet that uses the Mellor and Yamada level 2.5 turbulence closure scheme and that accounts for the combined influence of the winds, tides, and freshwater runoff has been used to produce 30-day simulations of the velocity and density field in the inlet.

The tidal currents are typically overlaid by a weak horizontal density gradient due to freshwater run-off from land. The observations in an energetic tidal channel clearly show the expected effects of tidal straining: destratification during flood and increased stratification during ebb. Microstructure observations are consistent with the tidal straining dynamics: during the flood relatively high values of viscous dissipation are observed whilst during ebb the values are substantially smaller. It is also shown that the tidal cycle of stratification and destratification depends on the position in the tidal channel. In parts of the channel, increased stratification occurs during full flood, a phenomenon which can only be explained by advection of stratified water masses formed outside the tidal channel. The observations presented here show the general significance of the tidal straining process for tidally energetic weakly stratified regimes.}},

Seaward of that point, the bathymetry is modeled with an exponentially decaying function of distance. The linearized, barotropic equations of hydrostatic motion, subject to the long-wave approximation, yield separate shelf and slope solutions, which are matched at the shelf break to specify the eigenfunctions. The associated eigenvalues define the dispersion relations for each of the modes. Wavenumber–frequency pairs derived from NOAA sea surface height stations along the coast are plotted on the first-mode dispersion curve, and the agreement is good.

This simulation resolves smaller scales (down to ≈10 km) than altimetric data (limited to 70 km because of the noise level). In high eddy kinetic energy (EKE) regions (as in the western part), SSH spectral slope almost follows a k−4 (with k the wavenumber) or slightly steeper law in agreement with altimeter studies. The new result is that, unlike altimeter studies, such a k−4 slope is also observed in low EKE regions (as in the eastern part). In these regions, this slope mostly concerns scales not well resolved by altimetric data. Such k−4 SSH spectral slopes are weaker from what is expected from quasigeostrophic turbulence theory but closer to surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) turbulence theory. The consequence is that the small scales concerned...}},

With very low background noise levels and approximately 27 months of high-quality records, tidal constituents can be estimated with unusually high precision. This includes many high-frequency lines up through the seventh-diurnal band. The station deployment provides a unique opportunity to compare with tides estimated from satellite altimetry, point by point along the satellite track, in a region of moderately high mesoscale variability. That variability can significantly corrupt altimeter-based tide estimates, even with 17 years of data. A method to improve the along-track altimeter estimates by correcting the data for non-tidal variability is found to yield much better agreement with the bottom-pressure data. The technique should prove useful in certain demanding applications, such as altimetric studies of internal tides.}},

Thus, in addition to the energy input to the near inertial waves of 0.5–0.7 TW reported by Alford and by Watanabe and Hibiya, the total energy input to the Ekman layer is estimated as 3 TW.

SLR is implemented through a uniform depth increase across the model domain, with a comparison between the implementation of coastal defences or allowing low-lying land to flood. The complex spatial response of the semi-diurnal M<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2</sub></span> constituent does not appear to be linear with the imposed SLR. The most predominant features of this response are the generation of new amphidromic systems within the Gulf of Carpentaria and large-amplitude changes in the Arafura Sea, to the north of Australia, and within embayments along Australia's north-west coast. Dissipation from M<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2</sub></span> notably decreases along north-west Australia but is enhanced around New Zealand and the island chains to the north. The diurnal constituent, K<span class="inline-formula"><sub>1</sub></span>, is found to decrease in amplitude in the Gulf of Carpentaria when flooding is allowed. Coastal flooding has a profound impact on the response of tidal amplitudes to SLR by creating local regions of increased tidal dissipation and altering the coastal topography. Our results also highlight the necessity for regional models to use correct open boundary conditions reflecting the global tidal changes in response to SLR.</p>}},

A new global 1/4° resolution MDT was computed for the 1993–1999 time period with improved data and methodology compared to the previous RIO05 MDT field. First, a large-scale MDT is obtained from the CLS01 altimetric Mean Sea Surface and a recent geoid model computed from 4.5 years of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data. Altimetric sea level anomalies and in situ measurements are then combined to compute synthetic estimates of the MDT and the corresponding mean currents. While the RIO05 MDT was based on 10 years of in situ dynamic heights and drifting buoy velocities, the new field benefits from an enlarged data set of in situ measurements ranging from 1993 to 2008 and includes all hydrological profiles from the Argo array. Moreover, the processing of the in situ data has been updated. A new Ekman model was developed to extract the geostrophic velocity component from the drifting buoy measurements. The handling of hydrologic measurements has also been revisited. Compared to the previous RIO05 solution, the new global MDT resolves much stronger gradients in western boundary currents, with mean velocities being doubled in some places. Moreover, in comparison to several other recent MDT estimates, we find that the new CNES-CLS09 MDT is in better agreement with independent in situ observations.}},

The time-averaged annual maximum water level correlates significantly with, and scales as 2.5 times, the water level standard deviation at the tide gauge stations. This relationship is used to estimate time-averaged annual maximum water level on a nearly continuous global scale (excluding ice-covered polar regions) by specifying variance maps of the tides from a tide model, the seasonal and low-frequency residual components from satellite altimetry sea surface height, and the high-frequency residual component from an atmospheric reanalysis product. The variance fields are combined to estimate time-averaged annual maximum water levels that compare well with observed values at the tide gauge stations.

The scheme also allows for sequential correction of temperature and salinity biases and online estimation of background error covariance parameters. Two North Atlantic applications, both focused on predicting mesoscale variability, are used to assess the effectiveness of the scheme. In the first application the background is a monthly temperature and salinity climatology and skill is assessed by how well the scheme recovers Argo profiles that were not assimilated.

abstract = {{The increasing resolution of ground based gravity measurements (e.g. by superconducting gravimeters) as well as satellite based gravity field studies allows to study very small signals, globally as well as local. On the other hand, this requires the correction of such signals to uncover others. To study the Earth’s deep interior and the on-going dynamic processes requires the correction of disturbing signals, and one of these signals is related to ocean tidal loading. Although new ocean tide models are being derived from current satellite missions, there are still uncertainties. In this paper we present an intercomparison ocean tide models to test their fit to world-wide observations. Therefore, three TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) satellite derived models (CSR3.0, FES95.2 and TPXO.2) beside the classical SCHW80 model were selected for an accuracy assessment study. The selected models have been subjected to an intercomparison test, tide gauge validation test and comparison to 59 tidal gravity stations. The intercomparison test shows a good agreement between the T/P-based models for the open ocean and remarkable disagreement between the selected models in the coastal regions indicating that such models are still problematic in these regions. The tide gauge validation shows that the T/P derived models fit tide gauges better than SCHW80, with a better fit for the semidiurnal constituents than for the diurnal constituents. Comparing the gravimetric ocean-tide loading computed from the selected models with the residuals from a set of 59 tidal gravity stations shows that there is an improvement of the T/P derived models with respect to the Schwiderski model, especially in M2. However, this improvement is not as significant as the result of the comparison with the pelagic data. The procedure developed for the comparison of T/P derived models with SCHW80 is presented. The results provide not only information and improvement with regard to SCHW80, but also information about the properties of the new models. It is intended to continue this work applying the very recent models to see how they perform compared to this study. With this study we provide boundary conditions for the improvement of new ocean-tide models in order to benefit from the gravity measurements now possible regarding the evaluation of Earth structures and dynamic processes.}},

abstract = {{Currently the NOAA Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) is transitioning the primary water level sensor at most NWLON stations, from an acoustic ranging system, to microwave radars. With no stilling well and higher resolution of the open sea surface, microwave radars have the potential to provide real-time wave measurements at NWLON sites. Radar sensors at tide stations may offer a low cost, convenient way to increase nearshore wave observational coverage throughout the U.S. to support navigational safety and ocean research applications. Here we present the results of a field study, comparing wave height measurements from four radar water level sensors, with two different signal types (pulse and continuous wave swept frequency modulation-CWFM). A nearby bottom acoustic wave and current sensor is used as a reference. An overview of field setup and sensors will be presented, along with an analysis of performance capabilities of each radar sensor. The study includes results from two successive field tests. In the first, we examine the performance from a pulse microwave radar (WaterLOG H-3611) and two CWFM (Miros SM-94 and Miros SM-140). While both types of radars tracked significant wave height well over the test period, the pulse radar had less success resolving high frequency wind wave energy and showed a high level of noise toward the low frequency end of the spectrum. The pulse WaterLOG radar limitations were most apparent during times of high winds and locally developing seas. The CWFM radars demonstrated greater capability to resolve those higher frequency energies, while avoiding low frequency noise. The initial field test results motivated a second field test, focused on the comparison of wave height measurements from two pulse radar water level sensors, the WaterLOG H3611 and the Endress and Hauser Micropilot FMR240. Significant wave height measurements from both radar water level sensors compared well to reference AWAC measurements over the test period, but once again the WaterLOG radar did not adequately resolve wind wave energy in high frequency bands and showed a high level of noise toward the low frequency end of the spectrum. The E+H radar demonstrated greater capability to resolve those higher frequency energies while avoiding the low frequency aliasing issue observed in the WaterLOG.}},

During this decade, the French tidal group (FTG), led by C. Le Provost, produced a series of finite element solutions (FES) tidal atlases, among which FES2004 is the latest release, computed from the tidal hydrodynamic equations and data assimilation. The aim of this paper is to review the state of the art of tidal modelling and the progress achieved during this past decade. The first sections summarise the general FTG approach to modelling the global tides. In the following sections, we introduce the FES2004 tidal atlas and validate the model against in situ and satellite data. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of the FES2004 release compared to earlier FES tidal atlases, and we recommend its use in tidal applications. The final section focuses on the new dissipation term added to the equations, which aims to account for the conversion of barotropic energy into internal tidal energy. There is a huge improvement in the hydrodynamic tidal solution and energy budget obtained when this term is taken into account.}},

abstract = {{This paper develops an analysis framework to identify how physical processes, as represented in ocean climate models, impact the evolution of global mean sea level. The formulation utilizes the coarse grained equations appropriate for an ocean model, and starts from the vertically integrated mass conservation equation in its Lagrangian form. Global integration of this kinematic equation results in an evolution equation for global mean sea level that depends on two physical processes: boundary fluxes of mass and the non-Boussinesq steric effect. The non-Boussinesq steric effect itself contains contributions from boundary fluxes of buoyancy; interior buoyancy changes associated with parameterized subgrid scale processes; and motion across pressure surfaces. The non-Boussinesq steric effect can be diagnosed in either volume conserving Boussinesq or mass conserving non-Boussinesq ocean circulation models, with differences found to be negligible.We find that surface heating is the dominant term affecting sea level arising from buoyancy fluxes, contributing to a net positive tendency to global mean sea level, largely due to low latitude heating and because the thermal expansion coefficient is much larger in the tropics than high latitudes. Subgrid scale effects from parameterized quasi-Stokes transport, vertical diffusion, cabbeling, and thermobaricity are also found to be significant, each resulting in a reduction of global mean sea level. Sea level rise through low latitude heating is largely compensated by a sea level drop from poleward eddy heat transport and ocean mixing. Spatial variations in the thermal expansion coefficient provide an essential modulation of how physical effects from mixing and eddy induced advective transport impact global mean sea level.}},

Ocean tide height models are usually explicitly available at a few frequencies, and a smooth unit response is assumed to infer the response across the tidal spectrum. The convolution formalism of Munk and Cartwright (1966) models this response function with a Fourier series. This allows the total ocean tide height, and therefore the total ocean tide potential, to be modeled as a weighted sum of past, present, and future values of the tide-generating potential. Previous applications of the convolution formalism have usually been limited to tide height models, but we extend it to ocean tide potential models. We use luni-solar ephemerides to derive the required tide-generating potential so that the complete spectrum of the ocean tide potential is efficiently represented. In contrast, the traditionally adopted harmonic model of the ocean tide potential requires the explicit sum of the contributions from individual tidal frequencies. It is therefore subject to omission errors from neglected frequencies and is computationally more intensive. Intersatellite range rate data from the GRACE mission are used to compare convolution and harmonic models of the ocean tide potential. The monthly range rate residual variance is smaller by 4\&\#8211;5\%, and the daily residual variance is smaller by as much as 15\% when using the convolution model than when using a harmonic model that is defined by twice the number of parameters.}},

Findings show that the greatest average expense is incurred by “sneak” and “volatile” sequence structures, which are structures characterized by large and rapid increases in event probability at short lag times. These findings are simple quantitative illustration of the adage that large run-to-run variability of forecasts can be troublesome to a decision maker.

The approach also provides a means of assessing, and providing feedback on, the hydrological performance of the land-surface component of a regional climate model (RCM). When combined with information on the evolution of climate, the model can give estimates of the impact of future climate change on river flows and flooding. The high-resolution flow routing and runoff-production model is designed for use with RCM-derived rainfall and potential evaporation (PE), although other sources of gridded rainfall and PE can be employed. Called the 'Grid-to-Grid Model', or G2G, it can be configured on grids of different resolution and coverage (a 1 km grid over the UK is used here). The model can simulate flow on an area-wide basis as well as providing estimates of fluvial discharges for input to shelf-sea and ocean models. Configuration of the flow routing model on a relatively high resolution 1 km grid allows modelled river flows to be compared with gauged observations for a variety of catchments across the UK. Modelled flows are also compared with those obtained from a catchment-based model, a parameter-generalised form of the Probability-Distributed Model (PDM) developed for assessing flood frequency. Using RCM re-analysis rainfall and PE as input, the G2G model performs well compared with measured flows at a daily time-step, particularly for high relief catchments. It performs less well for low-relief and groundwater-dominated regions because the dominant model control on runoff production is topography.}},

A Kelvin wave incident on the eastern mouth of Bass Strait for example is shown to preferentially scatter energy into CTW modes 2 and 1 on the shelf, as well as driving a Poincaré wave field that results in a velocity jet trapped to the Victorian coast. Such coastal velocity jets are also a feature of the scattering of CTWs incident on a strait. For a mode n incident CTW, the fraction of net energy flux that enters the strait is also shown to be well approximated by h0bn2 where h0 is the strait depth and bn coupling coefficient.

abstract = {{Midlatitude gyres in the ocean are large scale horizontal circulations that are intensified on the western boundary of the ocean, giving rise to currents such as the Gulf Stream. The physical mechanism underlying gyres is widely recognised to involve the curl of the wind stress, which injects potential vorticity into the upper ocean. However, model results have highlighted the role of surface buoyancy fluxes (principally heating and cooling of the ocean surface) in driving circulation and enhancing gyre variability. Here we present two numerical simulations ‐‐ one in the fully turbulent regime and the second an eddy‐permitting ocean model ‐‐ which show that gyre‐like circulation can be driven by surface buoyancy fluxes alone. We explore this phenomenon through a combination of modelling and linear theory to highlight that the transport of ocean gyres depends upon surface buoyancy fluxes as well as wind stress. Ocean gyres are persistent, large‐scale circulation features that give rise to important ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic and the Kuroshio current off the east coast of Japan. These gyres are critical in transporting heat from the tropics to the poles. Standard oceanographic theory suggests that these gyres are driven by wind stress, however, the simple theory that predicts the strength of these gyres fails in many parts of the ocean. In this manuscript we demonstrate that ocean gyres (complete with a rich eddy field and strong western boundary current) occur even in the absence of wind forcing. Thus, we contend that a significant component of gyre circulation, particularly in the subpolar regions, is due to temperature‐driven buoyancy fluxes. This result represents a profound change to our understanding of one of the most fundamental aspects of the ocean’s large‐scale circulation. Simulations show that large‐scale midlatitude ocean gyres can be driven by buoyancy forcing alone. Scaling balance to estimate the relative contributions of wind and buoyancy forcing to gyre circulation is evaluated. Estimates of gyre transport should take surface buoyancy forcing into account.}}

Using real-time observational networks, crowdsourced data, physics-based and machine learning modeling approaches, model predictive control, and economic and social science methods, we are exploring ways to better understand and mitigate the impacts of street-scale flooding. Our research is showing how real-time control of stormwater infrastructure systems can help to improve the resilience of these systems during nuisance flooding events by strategically holding back rainfall runoff and preventing tidally driven stormwater backups. We are also showing physics-based and machine-learning methods can be combined for real-time decision support and how reputation system approaches can be used to measure trust in crowdsourced rainfall datasets. This presentation will provide an overview of these and related activities, each aimed at the common goal of leveraging real-time data from a variety of sources, innovative modeling techniques, and community-driven decision making to improve community resilience to nuisance flooding.}},

We demonstrate how this can be resolved using an approach to compositing that provides robust composites of multi-type environments. In addition to the visual aesthetics of the images created, we demonstrate the utility of these composites for further interpretation and analysis. This is enabled by the manner in which our approach captures the spatial variation in tidal dynamics through the use of a Voronoi mesh, and preserves the band relationships within the modelled spectra at each pixel. Case studies are presented which include continental-scale mosaics of the Australian coastline at high and low tide, and tailored examples demonstrating the potential of the tidally constrained composites to address a range of coastal change detection and monitoring applications. We conclude with a discussion on the potential applications of the composite products and method in the coastal and marine environment, as well as further development directions for our tidal modelling framework.}},

abstract = {{A series of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) is carried out with a global data assimilation system at 1/4∘ resolution using simulated data derived from a 1/12∘ resolution free-run simulation. The objective is to not only quantify how well multiple altimeter missions and Argo profiling floats can constrain the global ocean analysis and 7-day forecast at 1/4∘ resolution but also to better understand the sensitivity of results to data assimilation techniques used in Mercator Ocean operational systems. The impact of multiple altimeter data is clearly evidenced even at a 1/4∘ resolution. Seven-day forecasts of sea level and ocean currents are significantly improved when moving from one altimeter to two altimeters not only on the sea level, but also on the 3-D thermohaline structure and currents. In high-eddy-energy regions, sea level and surface current 7-day forecast errors when assimilating one altimeter data set are respectively 20 and 45 \% of the error of the simulation without assimilation. Seven-day forecasts of sea level and ocean currents continue to be improved when moving from one altimeter to two altimeters with a relative error reduction of almost 30 \%. The addition of a third altimeter still improves the 7-day forecasts even at this medium 1/4∘ resolution and brings an additional relative error reduction of about 10 \%. The error level of the analysis with one altimeter is close to the 7-day forecast error level when two or three altimeter data sets are assimilated. Assimilating altimeter data also improves the representation of the 3-D ocean fields. The addition of Argo has a major impact on improving temperature and demonstrates the essential role of Argo together with altimetry in constraining a global data assimilation system. Salinity fields are only marginally improved. Results derived from these OSSEs are consistent with those derived from experiments with real data (observing system evaluations, OSEs) but they allow for more detailed characterisation of errors on analyses and 7-day forecasts. Both OSEs and OSSEs should be systematically used and intercompared to test data assimilation systems and quantify the impact of existing observing systems.}},

This poses a problem of double-counting for operational forecasts of total water level during storm surges. In some surge forecasting, a regional model is run in two modes: tide only, with astronomic forcing alone; and tide and surge, forced additionally by surface winds and pressure. The surge residual is defined to be the difference between these configurations and is added to the local harmonic predictions from gauges. Here we use the Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM) based on Delft-FM to investigate this in the UK and elsewhere, quantifying the weather-related tides that may be double-counted in operational forecasts. We show that the global S2 atmospheric tide is captured by the tide-and-surge model and observe changes in other major constituents, including M2. The Lowest and Highest Astronomical Tide levels, used in navigation datums and design heights, are derived from tide predictions based on observations. We use our findings on radiational tides to quantify the extent to which these levels may contain weather-related components.}},

abstract = {{Tidal mixing fronts, which represent boundaries between stratified and tidally mixed waters, are locations of enhanced biological activity. They occur in summer shelf seas when, in the presence of strong tidal currents, mixing due to bottom friction balances buoyancy production due to seasonal heat flux. In this paper we examine the occurrence and fidelity of tidal mixing fronts in shelf seas generated within a global 3-dimensional simulation of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) that is simultaneously forced by atmospheric fields and the astronomical tidal potential. We perform a first order assessment of shelf sea tides in global HYCOM through comparison of sea surface temperature, sea surface tidal elevations, and tidal currents with observations. HYCOM was tuned to minimize errors in M2 sea surface heights in deep water. Over the global coastal and shelf seas (depths <200 m) the area-weighted root mean square error of the M2 sea surface amplitude in HYCOM represents 35\% of the 50 cm root mean squared M2 sea surface amplitude when compared to satellite constrained models TPXO8 and FES2014. HYCOM and the altimeter constrained tidal models TPXO8 and FES2014 exhibit similar skill in reproducing barotropic tidal currents estimated from in-situ current meter observations. Through comparison of a global HYCOM simulation with tidal forcing to a global HYCOM simulation with no tides, and also to previous regional studies of tidal mixing fronts in shelf seas, we demonstrate that HYCOM with embedded tides exhibits quite high skill in reproducing known tidal mixing fronts in shelf seas. Our results indicate that the amount of variability in the location of the tidal mixing fronts in HYCOM, estimated using the Simpson-Hunter parameter, is consistent with previous studies when the differences in the net downward heat flux, on a global scale, are taken into account. We also provide evidence of tidal mixing fronts on the North West Australian Shelf for which we have been unable to find references in the existing scientific literature.}},

abstract = {{A comprehensive observational data set was used to examine shoreward propagating semidiurnal internal tides as they shoal, break and run-up as turbulent boluses across the edge of the Australian North West Shelf (NWS), offshore Dampier, during late winter 2013. The measured waveforms and wavefields supported the grouping of events into two distinct categories: (1) pre-; and, (2) post- wave breaking. It was found that the transition from (1) to (2) was marked by the rise of nonlinear steepening (α) and reduction in dispersion (β), both coefficients that parameterize nonlinear wave effects on the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. We introduced a criterion for wave breaking from the dimensionless parameter (δ) that relates these two terms: wave breaking occurs when δ < 1. In the first group, dispersive effects were dominant to spread energy out of the semidiurnal wave to a dispersive wave packet of short-period internal solitary waves (ISWs). In the second, dispersion was considered small compared to the cumulative effect of nonlinear steepening. Here, the semidiurnal wave built sufficient energy at its rear face to generate wave breaking, which has been known to produce multiple turbulent boluses. Similar observations have not been described for this region during winter months and highlight that the nonlinear internal wave field is an important feature on the NWS throughout the year. Additionally, measurements obtained through autonomous ocean glider profiles revealed some of the post-breaking characteristics that included intensive vertical mixing and transport of dense water and suspended material onshore of the shelf break.}},

abstract = {{Are perturbations to ocean tides correlated with changing sea-level and climate, and how will this affect high water levels? Here, we survey 152 tide gauges in the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea and statistically evaluate how the sum of the four largest tidal constituents, a proxy for the highest astronomical tide (HAT), changes over seasonal and interannual time scales. We find that the variability in HAT is significantly correlated with sea-level variability; approximately 35\% of stations exhibit a greater than ±50 mm tidal change per meter sea-level fluctuation. Focusing on a subset of three stations with long records, probability density function (PDF) analyses of the 95\% percentile exceedance of total sea level (TSL) show long-term changes of this high-water metric. At Hong Kong, the increase in tides significantly amplifies the risk caused by sea-level rise. Regions of tidal decrease and/or amplification highlight the non-linear response to sea-level variations, with the potential to amplify or mitigate against the increased flood risk caused by sea-level rise. Overall, our analysis suggests that in many regions, local flood level determinations should consider the joint effects of non-stationary tides and mean sea level (MSL) at multiple time scales.}},

The simulated coastal M2 amplitudes, derived by a discrete Fourier transformation of the output sea level time series, are compared with the according values derived from satellite altimetry (TPXO-8 atlas). The experiments are repeated with four uniform and sixteen irregular triangular grids. The results show that the quality of the coastal tide simulation depends primarily on the coastal resolution and that the ocean interior can be resolved up to twenty times lower without causing considerable reductions in quality. The mesh transition zones between areas of different resolutions are formed by cell bisection and subsequent local spring optimisation tolerating a triangular cell’s maximum angle up to 84°. Numerical problems with these high-grade non-equiangular cells were not encountered. The results emphasise the numerical feasibility and potential efficiency of highly irregular computational meshes used by ICON-O.}},

abstract = {{Empirical modelling often aims for the simplest model consistent with the data. A new technique is presented which quantifies the consistency of the model dynamics as a function of location in state space. As is well-known, traditional statistics of nonlinear models like root-mean-square (RMS) forecast error can prove misleading. Testing consistency is shown to overcome some of the deficiencies of RMS error, both within the perfect model scenario and when applied to data from several physical systems using previously published models. In particular, testing for consistent nonlinear dynamics provides insight towards (i) identifying when a delay reconstruction fails to be an embedding, (ii) allowing state-dependent model selection and (iii) optimising local neighbourhood size. It also provides a more relevant (state dependent) threshold for identifying false nearest neighbours.}},

Modern ocean forecasting systems rely on data assimilation to estimate initial and boundary data, to interpolate and smooth sparse or noisy observations, and to evaluate observing systems and dynamical models. Every data assimilation system implements an optimality criterion which defines how to best combine dynamics and observations, given an hypothesized error model for both. The realization of practical ocean data assimilation systems is challenging due to both the technical issues of implementation, and the scientific issues of determining the appropriate set of hypothesized priors. This chapter reviews methodologies and highlights themes common to all approaches.}},

Forecast time series are aggregated from well-established operational systems of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology; although following some adjustments these systems are only quasi-complimentary. Target applications are routine coastal decision processes under non-extreme conditions. The configuration aims to be relatively robust to operational realities such as version upgrades, data gaps and metadata ambiguities. Forecast skill is evaluated against hourly tide gauge observations. Characteristics of the bias correction term are demonstrated to be primarily static in time, with time varying signals showing regional coherence. This simple approach to exploiting existing complex systems can offer valuable levels of skill at a range of Australian locations. The prospect of interpolation between observation sites and exploitation of lagged-ensemble uncertainty estimates could be meaningfully pursued. Skill characteristics define a benchmark against which new operational sea level forecasting systems can be measured. More generally, an aggregation approach may prove to be optimal for routine sea level forecast services given the physically inhomogeneous processes involved and ability to incorporate ongoing improvements and extensions of source systems.}},

Considering the fact that the satellite altimetry technique can provide sea level observations at the global scale, spherical harmonics defined for the whole range of spherical coordinates (0 ≤ λ ≤ 2π, and − π/2 ≤ ϕ≤ +π/2) could be among the possible choices for global ocean tide modeling. However, when applied for modeling of global ocean tide, spherical harmonics lose their orthogonality due to the following reasons: (1) Observation of sea surface is made over discrete points, and not as a continuous function, which is needed for having the orthogonality property of spherical harmonics in functional space. (2) The range of application of spherical harmonics for global ocean tide modeling is limited to the sea areas covered by satellite altimetry observations and not the whole globe, which is also required for the fluffiness of the orthogonality of spherical harmonics. In this contribution we show how a set of orthonormal base functions at the sea areas covered by the satellite altimetry observations can be derived from spherical harmonics in order to solve the lack of orthogonality. Using the derived orthonormal base functions, a global MSL model, and empirical global ocean tide models for six major semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents, namely, S2, M2, N2, K1, P1, and O1 as well as three long term tidal components, i.e., Mf, Mm, and Ssa, are developed based on six years of Jason-1 satellite altimetry sea level data as a numerical case study.}},

abstract = {{Mandelbrot's fractal geometry is a revolution in topological space theory and, for the first time, provides the possibility of simulating and describing landscapes precisely by using a mathematical model. Fractal analysis appears to capture some “new” information that traditional parameters do not contain. A landscape should be (or is at most) statistically self-similar or statistically self-affine if it possesses a fractal nature. Mandelbrot's fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is the most useful mathematical model for simulating landscape surfaces. The fractal dimensions for different landscapes and calculated by different methods are difficult to compare. The limited size of the regions surveyed and the spatial resolution of the digital elevation models (DEMs) limit the precision and stability of the computed fractal dimension. Interpolation artifacts of DEMs and anisotropy create additional difficulties in the computation of fractal dimensions. Fractal dimensions appear to be spatially variable over landscapes. The region-dependent spatial variation of the dimension has more practical significance than the scale-dependent spatial variation. However, it is very difficult to use the fractal dimension as a distributed geomorphic parameter with high “spatial resolution”. The application of fractals to landscape analysis is a developing and immature field and much of the theoretical rigour of fractal geometry has not yet been exploited. The physical significance of landscape fractal characteristics remains to be explained. Research in geographical information theory and fractal theory needs to be strengthened in order to improve the application of fractal geometry to the geosciences.}},

Findings from the tide gauge data set are contrasted with those from a state-of-the-art global tide model. The study is of interest within tidal science, but also has practical importance regarding the type of mean level used to define land survey datums. In addition, an appreciation of MTL–MSL difference is important in the use of the historical sea level data used in climate change research, with implications for some of the data stored in international databanks. Particular studies are made of how MTL and MSL might differ through the year, and if MTL is measured in daylight hours only, as has been the practice of some national geodetic agencies on occasions in the past.}},

abstract = {{With more than 400,000 copies now in print, The Craft of Research is the unrivaled resource for researchers at every level, from first-year undergraduates to research reporters at corporations and government offices. Seasoned researchers and educators Gregory G. Colomb and Joseph M. Williams present an updated third edition of their classic handbook, whose first and second editions were written in collaboration with the late Wayne C. Booth. The Craft of Research explains how to build an argument that motivates readers to accept a claim; how to anticipate the reservations of readers and to respond to them appropriately; and how to create introductions and conclusions that answer that most demanding question, “So what?” The third edition includes an expanded discussion of the essential early stages of a research task: planning and drafting a paper. The authors have revised and fully updated their section on electronic research, emphasizing the need to distinguish between trustworthy sources (such as those found in libraries) and less reliable sources found with a quick Web search. A chapter on warrants has also been thoroughly reviewed to make this difficult subject easier for researchers Throughout, the authors have preserved the amiable tone, the reliable voice, and the sense of directness that have made this book indispensable for anyone undertaking a research project.}},

abstract = {{Storm wave run-up causes beach erosion, wave overtopping, and street flooding. Extreme runup estimates may be improved, relative to predictions from general empirical formulae with default parameter values, by using historical storm waves and eroded profiles in numerical runup simulations. A climatology of storm wave run-up at Imperial Beach, California is developed using the numerical model SWASH, and over a decade of hindcast spectral waves and observed depth profiles. For use in a local flood warning system, the relationship between incident wave energy spectra E(f) and SWASH-modeled shoreline water levels is approximated with the numerically simple integrated power law approximation (IPA). Broad and multi-peaked E(f) are accommodated by characterizing wave forcing with frequency-weighted integrals of E(f). This integral approach improves runup estimates compared to the more commonly used bulk parameterization using deep water wave height H0 and deep water wavelength L0 Hunt (Trans Am Soc Civ Eng 126(4):542–570, 1961) and Stockdon et al. (Coast Eng 53(7):573–588, 2006. 10.1016/j.coastaleng.2005.12.005). Scaling of energy and frequency contributions in IPA, determined by searching parameter space for the best fit to SWASH, show an H0L0 scaling is near optimal. IPA performance is tested with LiDAR observations of storm run-up, which reached 2.5 m above the offshore water level, overtopped backshore riprap, and eroded the foreshore beach slope. Driven with estimates from a regional wave model and observed βf, the IPA reproduced observed run-up with <30\% error. However, errors in model physics, depth profile, and incoming wave predictions partially cancelled. IPA (or alternative empirical forms) can be calibrated (using SWASH or similar) for sites where historical waves and eroded bathymetry are available.}},

abstract = {{It is proposed that the tidal input functions and observed tide be represented as linear combinations of a set of special orthogonal tidal functions, referred to as orthotides. These functions differ from the usual harmonic functions in that successive members represent successively more wiggliness in the linear admittance function. The tidal constants appropriate to this scheme are determined from the mean displaced products of the observed tide with the tidal input functions, as is done in the convolution method. Mean displaced products and linear orthotides were computed for the semidiurnal and diurnal gravitational tidal inputs. Results of Munk and Cartwright's analysis of 19 years of observed data from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Newlyn, England, were used to estimate the linear gravitational orthotide constants for those two places. The general decrease of magnitude with order of the estimated orthotide constants indicates that the tidal admittance is relatively smooth, as is expected. A procedure is outlined for a similar development of the bilinear tidal response. It is suggested that this orthogonal method be used for the routine analysis and prediction of tides, as it is more readily standardized and systematized than methods heretofore used.}},
