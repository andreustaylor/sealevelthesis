This thesis with publication addresses conceptual issues at the intersection of sea level forecasting, tides and mesoscale oceanography with implications for operational practice.
New methods for combining, evaluating and delivering nominally ``tidal'' sea level information are proposed and analysed; with a focus on representation issues and system compatibility.
The results are expected to inform the development of seamless forecasting services and assert that aspects of conventional tide prediction will maintain relevance by supporting increasingly sophisticated numerical and data-driven prognostic tools.
