abstract = {With more than 400,000 copies now in print, The Craft of Research is the unrivaled resource for researchers at every level, from first-year undergraduates to research reporters at corporations and government offices. Seasoned researchers and educators Gregory G. Colomb and Joseph M. Williams present an updated third edition of their classic handbook, whose first and second editions were written in collaboration with the late Wayne C. Booth. The Craft of Research explains how to build an argument that motivates readers to accept a claim; how to anticipate the reservations of readers and to respond to them appropriately; and how to create introductions and conclusions that answer that most demanding question, ``So what?'' The third edition includes an expanded discussion of the essential early stages of a research task: planning and drafting a paper. The authors have revised and fully updated their section on electronic research, emphasizing the need to distinguish between trustworthy sources (such as those found in libraries) and less reliable sources found with a quick Web search. A chapter on warrants has also been thoroughly reviewed to make this difficult subject easier for researchers Throughout, the authors have preserved the amiable tone, the reliable voice, and the sense of directness that have made this book indispensable for anyone undertaking a research project.},

abstract = {This book sets forth the physical, mathematical, and numerical foundations of computer models used to understand and predict the global ocean climate system. Aimed at students and researchers of ocean and climate science who seek to understand the physical content of ocean model equations and numerical methods for their solution, it is largely general in formulation and employs modern mathematical techniques. It also highlights certain areas of cutting-edge research. Stephen Griffies presents material that spans a broad spectrum of issues critical for modern ocean climate models. Topics are organized into parts consisting of related chapters, with each part largely self-contained. Early chapters focus on the basic equations arising from classical mechanics and thermodynamics used to rationalize ocean fluid dynamics. These equations are then cast into a form appropriate for numerical models of finite grid resolution. Basic discretization methods are described for commonly used classes of ocean climate models. The book proceeds to focus on the parameterization of phenomena occurring at scales unresolved by the ocean model, which represents a large part of modern oceanographic research. The final part provides a tutorial on the tensor methods that are used throughout the book, in a general and elegant fashion, to formulate the equations.},

A global sampling of along-track sea-surface height wavenumber spectra finds that non-stationary variance is generally 25% or less of the average variance at wavenumbers characteristic of mode-1 tidal internal waves. With some exceptions the non-stationary variance does not exceed 0.25 cm2. The mode-2 signal, where detectable, contains a larger fraction of non-stationary variance, typically 50% or more. Temporal subsetting of the data reveals interannual variability barely significant compared with tidal estimation error from 3-year records. Comparison of summer vs. winter conditions shows only one region of noteworthy seasonal changes, the northern South China Sea. Implications for the anticipated SWOT altimeter mission are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Over 20 global ocean tide models have been developed since 1994, primarily as a consequence of analysis of the precise altimetric measurements from TOPEX/POSEIDON and as a result of parallel developments in numerical tidal modeling and data assimilation. This paper provides an accuracy assessment of 10 such tide models and discusses their benefits in many fields including geodesy, oceanography, and geophysics. A variety of tests indicate that all these tide models agree within 2{\&}{\#}8211;3 cm in the deep ocean, and they represent a significant improvement over the classical Schwiderski 1980 model by approximately 5 cm rms. As a result, two tide models were selected for the reprocessing of TOPEX/POSEIDON Geophysical Data Records in late 1995. Current ocean tide models allow an improved observation of deep ocean surface dynamic topography using satellite altimetry. Other significant contributions include their applications in an improved orbit computation for TOPEX/POSEIDON and other geodetic satellites, to yield accurate predictions of Earth rotation excitations and improved estimates of ocean loading corrections for geodetic observatories, and to allow better separation of astronomical tides from phenomena with meteorological and geophysical origins. The largest differences between these tide models occur in shallow waters, indicating that the current models are still problematic in these areas. Future improvement of global tide models is anticipated with additional high-quality altimeter data and with advances in numerical techniques to assimilate data into high-resolution hydrodynamic models.},

abstract = {This paper presents a five-year global simulation of HYCOM, the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model, that simultaneously resolves the eddying general circulation, barotropic tides, and baroclinic tides with 32 layers in the vertical direction and 1/12.5$\,^{\circ}$ (equatorial) horizontal grid spacing. A parameterized topographic wave drag is inserted into the model and tuned so that the surface tidal elevations are of comparable accuracy to those in optimally tuned forward tide models used in previous studies. The model captures 93% of the open-ocean sea-surface height variance of the eight largest tidal constituents, as recorded by a standard set of 102 pelagic tide gauges spread around the World Ocean. In order to minimize the impact of the wave drag on non-tidal motions, the model utilizes a running 25-h average to approximately separate tidal and non-tidal components of the near-bottom flow. In contrast to earlier high-resolution global baroclinic tide simulations, which utilized tidal forcing only, the simulation presented here has a horizontally non-uniform stratification, supported by the wind- and buoyancy forcing. The horizontally varying stratification affects the baroclinic tides in high latitudes to first order. The magnitude of the internal tide perturbations to sea surface elevation amplitude and phase in a large box surrounding Hawai'i is quite similar to that observed in satellite altimeter data, although the exact locations of peaks and troughs in the modeled perturbations differ from those in the observed perturbations.},

abstract = {This paper examines the accuracy of surface elevations in a forward global numerical model of 10 tidal constituents. Both one-layer and two-layer simulations are performed. As far as the authors are aware, the two-layer simulations and the simulations in a companion paper (Deep-Sea Research II, 51 (2004) 3043) represent the first published global numerical solutions for baroclinic tides. Self-consistent forward solutions for the global tide are achieved with a convergent iteration procedure for the self-attraction and loading term. Energies are too large, and elevation accuracies are poor, unless substantial abyssal drag is present. Reasonably accurate tidal elevations can be obtained with a spatially uniform bulk drag c d or horizontal viscosity K H , but only if these are inordinately large. More plausible schemes concentrate drag over rough topography. The topographic drag scheme used here is based on an exact analytical solution for arbitrary small-amplitude terrain, and supplemented by dimensional analysis to account for drag due to flow-splitting and low-level turbulence as well as that due to breaking of radiating waves. The scheme is augmented by a multiplicative factor tuned to minimize elevation discrepancies with respect to the TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P)-constrained GOT99.2 model. The multiplicative factor may account for undersampled small spatial scales in bathymetric datasets. An optimally tuned multi-constituent one-layer simulation has an RMS elevation discrepancy of 9.54 cm with respect to GOT99.2, in waters deeper than 1000 m and over latitudes covered by T/P (66 ∘ N to 66 ∘ S). The surface elevation discrepancy decreases to 8.90 cm (92 percent of the height variance captured) in the optimally tuned two-layer solution. The improvement in accuracy is not due to the direct surface elevation signature of internal tides, which is of small amplitude, but to a shift in the barotropic tide induced by baroclinicity. Elevations are also more accurate in the two-layer model when pelagic tide gauges are used as the benchmark, and when the T/P-constrained TPXO6.2 model is used as a benchmark in deep waters south of 66 ∘ S. For Antarctic diurnal tides, the improvement in forward model elevation accuracy with baroclinicity is substantial. The optimal multiplicative factor in the two-layer case is nearly the same as in the one-layer case, against initial expectations that the explicit resolution of low-mode conversion would allow less parameterized drag. In the optimally tuned two-layer M 2 solution, local values of the ratio of temporally averaged squared upper layer speed to squared lower layer speed often exceed 10.},

abstract = {Abstract New empirical estimates of the long-period fortnightly (Mf) tide obtained from TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) altimeter data confirm significant basin-scale deviations from equilibrium. Elevations in the low-latitude Pacific have reduced amplitude and lag those in the Atlantic by 30$\,^{\circ}$ or more. These interbasin amplitude and phase variations are robust features that are reproduced by numerical solutions of the shallow-water equations, even for a constant-depth ocean with schematic interconnected rectangular basins. A simplified analytical model for cooscillating connected basins also reproduces the principal features observed in the empirical solutions. This simple model is largely kinematic. Zonally averaged elevations within a simple closed basin would be nearly in equilibrium with the gravitational potential, except for a constant offset required to conserve mass. With connected basins these offsets are mostly eliminated by interbasin mass flux. Because of rotation, this flux occurs mostly in a narrow bou...},

abstract = {AbstractFollowing recent studies based on altimetric data, this paper analyses the spectral characteristics of the sea surface height (SSH) using a new realistic simulation of the North Pacific Ocean with high resolution ( in the horizontal and 100 vertical levels). This simulation resolves smaller scales (down to ≈10 km) than altimetric data (limited to 70 km because of the noise level). In high eddy kinetic energy (EKE) regions (as in the western part), SSH spectral slope almost follows a k−4 (with k the wavenumber) or slightly steeper law in agreement with altimeter studies. The new result is that, unlike altimeter studies, such a k−4 slope is also observed in low EKE regions (as in the eastern part). In these regions, this slope mostly concerns scales not well resolved by altimetric data. Such k−4 SSH spectral slopes are weaker from what is expected from quasigeostrophic turbulence theory but closer to surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) turbulence theory. The consequence is that the small scales concerned...},

abstract = {It is proposed that the tidal input functions and observed tide be represented as linear combinations of a set of special orthogonal tidal functions, referred to as orthotides. These functions differ from the usual harmonic functions in that successive members represent successively more wiggliness in the linear admittance function. The tidal constants appropriate to this scheme are determined from the mean displaced products of the observed tide with the tidal input functions, as is done in the convolution method. Mean displaced products and linear orthotides were computed for the semidiurnal and diurnal gravitational tidal inputs. Results of Munk and Cartwright's analysis of 19 years of observed data from Honolulu, Hawaii, and Newlyn, England, were used to estimate the linear gravitational orthotide constants for those two places. The general decrease of magnitude with order of the estimated orthotide constants indicates that the tidal admittance is relatively smooth, as is expected. A procedure is outlined for a similar development of the bilinear tidal response. It is suggested that this orthogonal method be used for the routine analysis and prediction of tides, as it is more readily standardized and systematized than methods heretofore used.},

abstract = {Abstract In this paper the author presents the NSWC ocean tide model of the semidiurnal principal lunar (M2) tide in an atlas of ocean tidal charts and maps. The model is the computer result of a unique combination of mathematical and empirical techniques, which was introduced, extensively tested, and evaluated by Schwiderski (1978a, 1980a, b, 1983e). The computed M2 amplitudes and phases are tabulated along with all specially labeled empirical input data on a 1$\,^{\circ}$ × 1 $\,^{\circ}$ grid system in 42$\,^{\circ}$ × 71$\,^{\circ}$ overlapping charts covering the whole oceanic globe. Corresponding global and arctic corange and cotidal maps are included to provide a quick overview of the major tidal phenomena. Significant qualitative and quantitative features are explained and discussed for proper application. In particular, the charted harmonic constants may be used to compute instantaneous M2 ocean tides with an accuracy of better than 5 cm any time and anywhere in the open oceans. Limitations of this accuracy in coastal waters and border sea...},

abstract = {A computationally efficient approach to reducing omission errors in ocean tide potential models is derived and evaluated using data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. Ocean tide height models are usually explicitly available at a few frequencies, and a smooth unit response is assumed to infer the response across the tidal spectrum. The convolution formalism of Munk and Cartwright (1966) models this response function with a Fourier series. This allows the total ocean tide height, and therefore the total ocean tide potential, to be modeled as a weighted sum of past, present, and future values of the tide-generating potential. Previous applications of the convolution formalism have usually been limited to tide height models, but we extend it to ocean tide potential models. We use luni-solar ephemerides to derive the required tide-generating potential so that the complete spectrum of the ocean tide potential is efficiently represented. In contrast, the traditionally adopted harmonic model of the ocean tide potential requires the explicit sum of the contributions from individual tidal frequencies. It is therefore subject to omission errors from neglected frequencies and is computationally more intensive. Intersatellite range rate data from the GRACE mission are used to compare convolution and harmonic models of the ocean tide potential. The monthly range rate residual variance is smaller by 4{\&}{\#}8211;5%, and the daily residual variance is smaller by as much as 15% when using the convolution model than when using a harmonic model that is defined by twice the number of parameters.},

Further, the synthesis gives a spectral composition of certain well known tidal features and pairs of free oscillations are identified, diminishing their contribution either on a global or local scale.},

If the oceans are assumed to have an equilibrium response, then satellite altimeters effectively observe the equipotential surface that is associated with the solid Earth and ocean pole tide deformations. The long-wavelength component of the geocentric pole tide deformations at the Chandler wobble period is observed from T/P altimetry to be consistent with the theoretical self-consistent equilibrium response of the ocean pole tide. The geocentric pole tide explains 70% of the variance in the degree 2 order 1 spherical harmonic component of the residual sea surface heights that are observed by T/P, after removing the seasonal, inverse barometer, and lunisolar tidal effects. If the long-wavelength component of the ocean pole tide is assumed to have an equilibrium response at the Chandler wobble period, then satellite altimetry proves to be another geodetic technique that can be used to estimate the Love number k2 at that period.},

abstract = {Abstract An improved version of the global hydrodynamic tide solutions [finite element solutions (FESs) FES94, FES95.2.1, and FES98] has been developed, implemented, and validated. The new model is based on the resolution of the tidal barotropic equations on a global finite element grid without any open boundary condition, which leads to solutions independent of in situ data (no open boundary conditions and no assimilation). The accuracy of these ``free'' solutions is improved by assimilating tide gauge and TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) altimeter information through a representer assimilation method. This leads to the FES99 version of this model. For the eight main constituents of the tidal spectrum (M2, S2, N2, K2, 2N2, K1, O1, and Q1), about 700 tide gauges and 687 T/P altimetric measurements are assimilated. An original algorithm is developed to calculate the tidal harmonic constituents at crossover points of the T/P altimeter database. Additional work is performed for the S2 wave by reconsidering the inverse bar...},

Pictures and pulses---I want to know where they came from, how pictures and counts got to be the bottom-line data of physics." (from the preface) Image and Logic is the most detailed engagement to date with the impact of modern technology on what it means to "do" physics and to be a physicist. At the beginning of this century, physics was usually done by a lone researcher who put together experimental apparatus on a benchtop. Now experiments frequently are larger than a city block, and experimental physicists live very different lives: programming computers, working with industry, coordinating vast teams of scientists and engineers, and playing politics. Peter L. Galison probes the material culture of experimental microphysics to reveal how the ever-increasing scale and complexity of apparatus have distanced physicists from the very science that drew them into experimenting, and have fragmented microphysics into different technical traditions much as apparatus have fragmented atoms to get at the fundamental building blocks of matter. At the same time, the necessity for teamwork in operating multimillion-dollar machines has created dynamic "trading zones," where instrument makers, theorists, and experimentalists meet, share knowledge, and coordinate the extraordinarily diverse pieces of the culture of modern microphysics: work, machines, evidence, and argument.},

abstract = {During the 1990s, a large number of new tidal atlases were developed, primarily to provide accurate tidal corrections for satellite altimetry applications. During this decade, the French tidal group (FTG), led by C. Le Provost, produced a series of finite element solutions (FES) tidal atlases, among which FES2004 is the latest release, computed from the tidal hydrodynamic equations and data assimilation. The aim of this paper is to review the state of the art of tidal modelling and the progress achieved during this past decade. The first sections summarise the general FTG approach to modelling the global tides. In the following sections, we introduce the FES2004 tidal atlas and validate the model against in situ and satellite data. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of the FES2004 release compared to earlier FES tidal atlases, and we recommend its use in tidal applications. The final section focuses on the new dissipation term added to the equations, which aims to account for the conversion of barotropic energy into internal tidal energy. There is a huge improvement in the hydrodynamic tidal solution and energy budget obtained when this term is taken into account.},

abstract = {In this contribution an empirical approach to global ocean tide and Mean Sea Level (MSL) modeling based on satellite altimetry observations is presented with all details. Considering the fact that the satellite altimetry technique can provide sea level observations at the global scale, spherical harmonics defined for the whole range of spherical coordinates (0 ≤ $\lambda$ ≤ 2$\pi$, and − $\pi$/2 ≤ $\phi$≤ +$\pi$/2) could be among the possible choices for global ocean tide modeling. However, when applied for modeling of global ocean tide, spherical harmonics lose their orthogonality due to the following reasons: (1) Observation of sea surface is made over discrete points, and not as a continuous function, which is needed for having the orthogonality property of spherical harmonics in functional space. (2) The range of application of spherical harmonics for global ocean tide modeling is limited to the sea areas covered by satellite altimetry observations and not the whole globe, which is also required for the fluffiness of the orthogonality of spherical harmonics. In this contribution we show how a set of orthonormal base functions at the sea areas covered by the satellite altimetry observations can be derived from spherical harmonics in order to solve the lack of orthogonality. Using the derived orthonormal base functions, a global MSL model, and empirical global ocean tide models for six major semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents, namely, S2, M2, N2, K1, P1, and O1 as well as three long term tidal components, i.e., Mf, Mm, and Ssa, are developed based on six years of Jason-1 satellite altimetry sea level data as a numerical case study.},

abstract = {This paper reviews operational systems used for real-time prediction of tides, surges and waves in northwest Europe. The review takes the form of a `snapshot' of models, related observing systems and dissemination procedures in use early in 1999. A brief account of surge, tide and wave dynamics and factors influencing them combined with regional factors such as water depth, shallow water extent, exposure (fetch), etc., provides a basis for understanding the diversity in design and implementation of the different national systems. It is shown that the systems in the different coastal states have evolved to address the needs of their own coastal and marine environments; take account of relevant processes and dynamics; and employ technologies such as data assimilation where appropriate. As a result, there are areas of common interest and overlap. Possibilities for rationalising systems or enhancing benefits by sharing of forecast products and data are discussed. Improved communication among operational agencies, perhaps using the PROMISE web pages (http://www.pol.ac.uk/promise/) to facilitate exchange of information on systems, operational developments and experience, is suggested as a means of encouraging collaboration and dissemination of new techniques.},

abstract = {Current and new applications of 2D storm surge models such as the Dutch Continental Shelf Model (DCSM) require that the models provide proper estimates of the instantaneous water levels expressed relative to a particular geoid, rather than only the tide and surge components expressed relative to the ill-defined model's zero height surface. For DCSM, this is realized by adding the depth-averaged horizontal baroclinic pressure gradients to the model equations, which are derived from 4D salinity and temperature fields provided by the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory hydrodynamic model (POL's hindcast). The vertical datum of the extended model is fixed to that of the European Gravimetric Geoid model 2008 (EGG08). This is done by an adjustment of the model parameters that depend on the choice of the reference surface (e.g., bathymetry) and by referring the water levels along the open boundaries to this reference surface. Using different numerical experiments we investigate the effects on the water levels of several approximations we have made during the implementation. The ability of the model to reproduce both the mean sea level (MSL) and instantaneous water levels is assessed by a comparison with the MSL derived from POL's hindcast as well as with instantaneous water levels acquired by various radar altimeter satellites. From this comparison we conclude that our modeled MSL is in good agreement with the MSL derived from POL's hindcast; the standard deviation of the differences is below 2 cm. However, larger differences in MSL are observed when comparing the model output with the MSL derived from radar altimeter data. They are attributed to either geoid errors or errors in the used salinity and temperature fields. The root mean squared (rms) differences between observed and modeled instantaneous water levels over the entire model domain varies from 9 cm for data acquired by the TOPEX satellite to 11 cm for data acquired by the GFO-1 satellite. These numbers improve to 8--10 cm on the North Sea, for data acquired by the TOPEX and ERS-2 satellites, respectively. These numbers are a factor two to three larger than the expected accuracy of water levels derived from radar altimeter data (which is ∼ 4 cm ). About 25% of these differences can be explained by a bias between the modeled and observed water levels of a single satellite pass. These biases are attributed to errors in the applied correction for the net steric expansion/contraction of the global oceans as this is not captured by DCSM that makes use of the Boussinesq approximation, as well as other errors in model and data.},
